systemd.
Despite controversy systemd has got it won't be abandoned for a long time. If your server use it then go with it. If your system uses Upstart then rather stick with supervisor or look for other answers.
Largely due to a difference in acoustic sensitivity which varies based on which language you grow up with, compounded by articulation habits. Also, there is a difference between the usefulness of learning Indian English (regional lingua franca) compared to the American or British dialects, depending on where you live. 
the point is, the guy doesn't have to change his accent because you don't like it. What does improve mean in this context? It's perfectly understandable
I believe the latter depends only on your work place. PS: Indian English...
It's not about one guy. It's about 99% of them.
At first i wasn't that much into it, but i grew a **huge** amount of respect for Z. A. Shaw. He focusses on making you a good programmer rather than on the language. And that makes sense, because language is a moving target, while being a good programmer isn't. "Exercise 23: Strings, Bytes, and Character Encodings" blew me away, as the members got bits, bytes, ascii, utf8 and unicode in one felt swoop. Big kudos to "Exercise 46: A Project Skeleton" too, teaching students how to get organised. "Exercise 47: Automated Testing" also great, and even sneaking in "Exercise 44: Inheritance Vs. Composition" which you wouldn't expect in a beginner book. I'm no longer using the material, because it's aimed at offline learning. Coding is **hard** and Z. A. Shaw teaches you the most important skill of all: determination. Learning from Z.A Shaw feels like running up a steep hill every morning, and eating nothing but dark greens 3x a day. Yes it hurts but you'll get good fast because it's hard and very hands-on. That style is not for everybody. I'm no longer using the content, because my churn rate was much too high, and it's tailored for offline learning. My content is focussed on the platforms i'm targeting: online, and social media. But i cannot speak more highly of LPTHW. 
Decorators are a little beyond Python basics, but I agree, this would probably be better to post at [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython). 
&gt; Anyway, I'm not here to argue with OP or anything. I just wish OP wouldn't use materials from this clown, that's all. It's easy to criticise, harder to create.
No.
God no. You can learn Python on pretty much any potato-quality computer. You can even run it in the browser using something like PythonAnywhere if you want. Pretty much any computer made in the last 20 years will run Python well enough for you to learn.
Not at all. You can run Python quite effectively on a Raspberry Pi Zero, which is a computer barely bigger than a matchbox. 
&gt; you lost a lot of credibility right here. Judge my credibility on my content please: https://www.facebook.com/codebasetech/videos/400550887157128 Not sure what LPTHW has to do with _my_ credibility as an instructor. ;)
You're not gonna survive in IT if you can't stand Indian youtube tutorial videos.

Works fine for 15 years now. I'll be fine.
Just a little entitled are we? As someone who is apparently better than the rest of the sheep out there, and who feels that paying for education is beneath him, I suggest you just learn Python from first principles and don't lower yourself to use someone else's instructions.
If you want to mod games learn lua. If you already know python/javascript, Lua is very very easy to learn and is interesting in it's own right. 
I am working on a small package that in essence is all about calculating how one image is similar to another. Using similarity metrics one can get numerical value that represents aforementioned similarity. I have not found package that groups such methods. Most of such metrics are scattered throughout internet in form of one time scripts. Its small in features for now but I believe the core is solid and ready to be extended. I would happily hear any ideas, requests and thoughts about it. You can find it [here](https://github.com/JenioPY/compimg).
I mean, my problem is that I suffer from social isolation and depression so I don't want to waste (my parent's) money on things I could drop out because of an anxiety attack or something. On the other hand I want absolute freedom to learn, but I accept the need for exams. &gt;I suggest you just learn Python from first principles and don't lower yourself to use someone else's instructions. Soooo, reading all the librairies? XD What I want is to see real Python applications and what exactly prorgrammers do because till this day I find coding very useless. 
The attitude you show will really get you nowhere. If you want a respected certification, you will have to pay money. Period. If you do not want to pay, you can use Google to find open lecture materials of some universities. This may get you some knowledge, but no certification or validation of your skill.
Indians do pick up the western accent once they start interacting with native English speakers. For people living in India, English is not the first language and have no means to practice the neutral accent. Ideally, Indians should not be expected to speak English at all. Considering today’s economy where Google has higher ad rates for western viewers and a chunk of target audience know English, the creators are forced to deliver it in English. Personally, I hope the accent improves, but won’t expect them to improve it. I am sure you would be much worse if you try to speak in Malayalam or Bengali.
I beg to differ. I live in Australia and bee to US — taxi drivers, cleaners, servos — thickest accent ever. Although my friends in second-third generation have little to none obviously. PS: I don't wanna speak Indian :) I speak Russian, English, French, a bit of German, so that's enough for me. 
Isn't that illegal.
Ok
You already have absolute freedom to learn. There are so many resources available to you on the Internet it’s almost ridiculous. That’s not really what you want, though — you want to be spoon-fed all the knowledge the rest of us gained from years of experience, and you want it for free. Good luck with that. Let us know how it goes.
Hi, Honestly this is way beyond my level and very different from what I use python for, but if you feel like practicing I'll read whatever teaches me new things.
At my work, Python 2 is still the default. We will have to do some hard work to port everything to Python 3. Especially since some software still uses old libraries that are no longer supported. To be honest, we have a lot of software that's even older. At our company IT got neglected for years.
Why would it be illegal?
Check rmotr out -&gt; https://rmotr.com/ I think it fits what you are looking for and it''s a quarter of the price, covers everything listed in that syllabus, it's an online classroom with classes via voom. You have exercises and projects to complete throughout the week. You can sign up and try the first week for free. If you don't like it atleast you will know before spending money. I'm a current student and highly recommend it. So far I've learnt quite a bit (you also need to put in the time)
Well, this is your opportunity to get some help on topics you are struggling with. You get to pick a subject.
1. Once your program exits, the console window exits along with it. You can add an extra call to `input()` at the end of your program to prevent it from auto-closing until you press Enter, or you can run it from a dedicated console window. 2. /r/learnpython
I'm in the US... There are soo many accents and dialects it would be crazy to practice tolerance for one and not for another. Intolerances like this are usually developed from inexperience or a really bad experience. I feel sorry for people who experience either, it sucks to know we are this quick in the world to critique one another so hard. I have a hard time with some accents. They are soothing and make me fall asleep. This is a big reason why I stay away from some accented videos, especially tutorials. If I had a gripe about the ones I do watch, I laugh at how easy it seems that an improvement can be made to help. For I'm not only having a difficult time with a soothing accent but there is also less relatable emotions like humor. This to me is the area that I've noticed have a larger affect on my concentration in viewing. 
And after only reading the title I was here like "maybe he forgot to join threads... maybe he spawned another process and it now has defunct processes..."
&gt; There are so many resources available to you on the Internet it’s almost ridiculous. There's the problem. Choice's paradox.
I'm not saying anything about free certifications.
As a native English speaker, I feel really lucky that a lot of talented Indians (and other nationalities) make these videos in English and don't just default to their native tongue. He speaks my language far, far better than I speak his. Thanks for the video!
&gt;since passwords have high information entropy (they are closer to random than a standard English phrase) &amp;#x200B; Don't forget 4: Use long passphrases instead of shorter, random passwords. So `correct horse battery staple` instead of `2G6Ugmv@%bF4FB` That way, detecting what's just a regular copy-paste from a password copy-paste is near impossible.
It doesn't "skip" anything - the functions don't run when they are defined, they run when they are called. Also, /r/learnpython.
I'm sorry what? You realize part of why they have that accent is because they are speaking a second language to their native one...a second language which happens to be your language...
My language is Russia. English is the second, but I don't have a thick Russian accent though
I'm not agreeing with this dude but I feel that English is becoming the language of the world, and I base that on several systems that demand English, like air traffic control and such... But we should realize people making free content in our language ( their second) is a treat for us and we shouldn't crap on an accent
I'm gonna bet you do, from an English speaker's perspective
I said “thick” — people would usually say I'm from Canada or Germany (and some other weird shit). But never guess.
That's legal, why wouldn't it be? You don't live in North Korea do you?
Good point!

THANK YOU, also yeah I'll be using the learn python sub from now on
Please read the sidebar to learn how to format your code correctly so it doesn't look like crap. (Hint: if you have a text editor open on your computer, you can type the code in that, select it, use your editor's "indent" command (often the TAB key), copy and paste into your browser text box. It takes longer to describe than to do it.) How do you expect `g()` to be called before it is called by `f()`?

Use a loop around your plot function. Use the loop iterator to advance the plot.
For sure, thanks~ As I'm expecting to learn how to do some ETL job with Python against maybe several databases (top of my head, SQL Server, PostgreSQL and MySQL, pretty sure these three are used extensively with our IT, they also use BigQuery and Vertica but well beyond my touch), what subject would you recommend I pick up? I know ORM and played with SQLAlchemy for a bit, but not sure if it helps with ETL. Wish I had a list of ETL jobs IT uses, but since I don't work in IT it's difficult to get one. I'd say batch import from different sources -- csv the most common. Also they migrate from one database to another pretty often (I don't know the reason though). Plus they build data warehouse in SQL Server so probably need a lot of ETL from the OTLP databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL). 
use pythontutor.com to visualize what is happening.
`systemd` unless I'm running in a container, in which case my process is being managed by Docker.
I wouldn't recommend ORM for ETL, as ORM is better suited for CRUD-like stuff. Depending on db size and complexity of the transformations, considering that you are on GCP, I would recommend learning Dataproc / Apache Beam. I might be able to help you out, but it would be useful to have some functional description of what you are trying to achieve. Since you are not in IT, are you an Analyst? Or Data Scientist maybe?

Yes, that would be really nice of you. I appreciate it.

No, it's not python specific. The best answers will be the same whether you are using python, Javascript, or C#. It's like asking how to extract digits from text. The answer is regular expressions and python doesn't have anything to do with that Ander, because it's a question about techniques, not a question about coding. 
Okay, I found something weird. I installed Wing Personal. It recognized Python 3.6, everything's working, tkinter works. But PyCharm for some reason recognize 3.6 as 3.7. I'm glad you tried to help me. Maybe I really should think about something a bit easier. :) At least for now. 
There's a bunch of fear mongering around form autofills from 2017 but nothing recent. Those have since been updated to not fill out a form unprompted. That was also about scraping personal details and not passwords. Password form autofills are keyed to a DNS address so they won't activate for phished websites.
It is probably a python versioning thing. I.e. your system installed praw in the location for python 2, but you're launching it with python 3. You should really only be coding with python 3 these days, but Linux systems still need python 2 installed to operate. Try installing praw with pip3: pip3 install praw And then launch with python 3.x. Say your script is called run.py, launch like this: python3 run.py In future, you'll get better help if you post to /r/learnpython.
If you can run a web browser responsively, you are fine. My 10 year old laptop can’t do that and I still run python on it. It used to be my workhorse.
&gt; This kind of thing has been a danger for a while since passwords have high information entropy (they are closer to random than a standard English phrase) you can detect them from a stream of characters, e.g. a keylogger, and steal them. If somebody has remote access to your computer they already have access to your password container. 
It’s probably more like 50%, but it’s dropped 20% or so in the last year and that decline is accelerating.
That 90% number is based on faulty counts for python 2. It’s inflated. Some issue on how things are counted by pypi.
You have two copies of python installed.
Create function where you return the size of passed list. Create function where you return all the possible combinations of passed list for passed length (use \`itertools.combinations\`). Create function where you return list or None depending does sum of the list (\`sum(passed\_list\`) equals passed sum. Create main loop where you make a nested for loops where outer is size and inner is combinations. Add list under inner loop to result list if it doesn't return None when checking for sum call is executed. &amp;#x200B;
Thank you for your reply, I've also posted this on /r/learnpython, I didn't realise this existed before making the current post.

Can rust beat c++ in numerics workloads?
Python itself will be too slow to do low latency audio signal processing. But if you have a library (written in C) that can do those low level high performance aspects, Python itself may be fine to write the rest of the high level code in. Maybe just using numpy / scipy is enough to do the audio processing That leaves the actual audio output. I've successfully used the sounddevice library to play audio but that was just mono or stereo. I have no idea if it is possible to do multichannel 3d/surround sound playback
Rust is sometimes faster than both C and C++, but sometimes slower also. In Rust certain optimizations are possible like this: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/aliasing.html I am not an expert in this area. But from what I have noticed, Idiomatic safe Rust itself is generally comparable to optimized C++. 
Interesting. Do you have python3 installed? What happens when you run the following: python --version or python3 version There might also be something wrong with your pip. It might be worth it to uninstall and reinstall. How you do this depends on which operating system you're working on.
You know nothing, fool! It's `chaos`, the god of destruction! 
I know rust trades with and sometimes beats C/++. I’m asking if for the specific workload of numerics that is also true. As an example, you might try taking the matrix product of two square arrays. This is extremely optimized in C/++ numerics libraries and might be &gt; 10x faster than the naive implementation.
Another question — if you just dumped your CSVs into pgsql, would that have been faster than spark?
After dumping it, using proper configuration, queries can be faster. But importing the csv files into the table itself is much slower. Here you can see that Rust code is almost I/O bounded in HDD. So for situations where you have to deal with data only few times, I feel that it is not worth it in DBs. 
I read the article and the readme and have no idea what this does, how it works or what requirements it has. Is it AWS EC2 only? Or AWS Lambda?
SIMD is available in stable Rust now. So it is possible to get similar performance to C++ code in vectorised numerical operations like matrix multiplication. See this extremely easy to use SIMD library in Rust. https://github.com/AdamNiederer/faster But from what I know, Fortran is the king of numerical computations. Lapack/blas are still SOTA in numerical computations. C/C++/Rust all have bindings for them. 
No, it can basically work with any load balanced environment there is no limitation on platform, it simply pickles and sends "set cache" method to all other nodes.
Image steganography. I think I heard a while back it is illegal. Idk

How do people typically account for noise? When he was showing the visual output it clearly picked up on walls and other objects but there were also some single dots sitting out in the middle of nowhere that are likely noise.
Wahoo. You sound amazing.
It really depends on how many dependencies they have. This could be super easy or a nightmare. Security wise, if they're really that concerned than maybe update to 3.5. It's a step in the right direction and will make future upgrades way easier. It's shipped with a bunch of distros already so it's definitely vetted.
That's not a DP solution
The latest you can, if your dependencies support it. Always. 
One time my buddy Steve was having a raccoon problem. He was always complaining about them getting in his attic and chattering away, chewing on the wires and otherwise being a nuisance. That’s when we deployed Stevie junior, a 5 foot long slithering squirrel slaying python of destruction. This was many years ago, and Steve hasn’t had any squirrel issues. Some say that to this day Stevie junior is still up there doing the Lord’s work 
On Linux people usually want to use a Python version that comes with the distro. So if you want to support deploying to Linux check what version come with the distros you want/need to support.
&gt;Python version that comes with the distro Yes we are using linux servers... So what's the problem with installing newer versions? Yes it is some harder, but I don't think that there is any other problem too.
This. I dropped python 2 for my own projects a year ago and am hard lobbying for my fellow researchers to follow this track. However, when they ask me what's so bad about python 2, and I reply «security support will be completely dropped a year from now», I get puzzled looks, because they don't know what it means. What is embarrassing is that... I don't think I get it either. Could you elaborate on this notion of «security» when it comes to updating python itself ?
I think what they refer to is that some packages may have bugs that have not been discovered yet since it's so new. This could be true but very unlikely. Honestly a pretty silly argument for not updating to Python 3 unless they have dependencies that are running only Python 2 which in that case it's time to ditch those dependencies. 
Yes I get the argument for avoiding latest version. I'm an enthusiastic updater myself and often find bugs that coworkers never have to face because they lag a few versions behind. What I don't get is what kind of security issues one might be dealing with by *not* updating python. Equivalently, I'm asking what kind of support is currently being brought to python 2 and what will change for users when it goes away.
Looks like the author took his own picture with his daughter and shopped the background and python logo in
python is backwards compatible, that means you'll have trouble if you use newer features not if you stick to older versions. Everything you do will run on 3.7 even if you stick to 3.5. That's why i'd probably go with 3.5 at this point ( i think Debian still uses it) that means your software will run on most servers without the need to install a newer special python version. I think both Ubuntu and Debian will get 3.7 this year. So it might not be a bad choice. But anyway if you don't need any special 3.7 features i don't see a good argument to not keep the code compatible with the standard installations of many operating systems by using only 3.5 features. That way you can run still on most of the recent (not just the newest) Linux distributions with the default python installation. 
/r/learnpython
More efficient way is to use the functions and get rid of the classes. OOP is not needed at all.
Alright, tahnk you! I can do it, it is just for me to try out. And also if possible can you tell me why isnt it more efficient to use classes?
yes it is harder is reason enough for most people. It will be harder for people to add your code to repositories. What would have been a simple installation of a few scripts is now the big task of maintaining a python3 version. Finding somebody to do that? Well you might but i wouldn't do it. I'd probably clone your project and throw out all 3.7 features. That's most likely less work and a nicer solution - can't remember the last time i have seen a specific python version installed with a package. Probably never? Will i install your software on my ubuntu lts server? No because i don't want to maintain a special python version, which brings all kinds of problems with it. Last time i tried i killed half of my server because some of the software didn't want to work the new python version - so i had to run 2 python versions an making sure every little scripts gets the version it wants is really annoying. I'd rather avoid that. Packages in a repository are usually just fined tuned to work with each other, try to mess with that system and you are on your own. 
It's not so much Python 2 that you have to worry about, but packages that use Python 2 that will no longer receive updates. A quick example is Django. They're ending their support for Python 2 in 2020 with 1.11. Once they stop updating, that means all security patches stop too. If you're running any sort of semi serious business application that is using a backend that is no longer getting security patches, that's crossing into the line of negligence. I'm sure if you look around you'll find a bunch of packages that stopped supporting Python 2 versions so that means no more security patches. That's the real danger of not upgrading Python 2.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. This is what I have been reading everywhere. I do not understand what we mean by «security patches», and it's the core of my question.
That's odd, despite using the program 'Python 3.5.3. Shell' And Thonny which states using version 3.5.3, I get this response: pi@RBP:~ $ python --version Python 2.7.13
Security patch is just an update that fixes a security issue. So like a bug fix but security specific. &amp;#x200B; Imagine if you found a bug in a software that could be used to grant yourself permissions that you otherwise shouldn't have. &amp;#x200B;
This is the Singleton pattern. And it'll work here as long as the login cookie doesn't expire. If it does, more work is needed to re-login before/after expiry. 
Ok I see. My notions are a bit blurry here because all I do is numerical simulation and data analysis, where's there are no such thing as permission granting, as far as I know. Thank you to everyone involved in this conversation and sorry for the confusion, it's on me :)
So you put a laser on a robot... ... nice!

That's the [subset sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem) problem, a well known algorithmic problem. You can find many algorithms for it, a quick google of "subset sum dynamic programmic" lead me [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subset-sum-problem-dp-25/)
You can tell this story is fake, because squirrels are a gift from God. One time I shoved a squirrel in a tulle and serialized it. I call it Squirrel Toople cereal, and it goes great with milk and runs on PowerPC: plus, it doesn't cost an ARM or a leg.

This does belong on /r/learnpython but since you're here, I'll give you some pointers: * `int *x` * `char **y` On the other hand, I do have some advice: * If you want to go down the OO path _AND_ all methods take the same arguments, do a class per implementation. However, unless you _must_ do this, I'd advise against it * Just put functions in a module and invoke those. This is effective the same as a class full of static methods anyways, just with the wrapping layer removed.
If you install software that doesn't come with the distro you have to take care about updates for security problems and other critical bugs yourself. You may have to compile the software for different distros or hardware architectures. It's not difficult, but it causes some additional work and adds some additional chance for bugs and errors. So admins usually try to avoid it if possible.
I'm still trying to learn a bit more Python. I made a simple script to help those kind people that like to hold lotteries on Reddit for giveaways and stuff! It scrapes the Reddit post page for all of the comments and selects the winner randomly! &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/connorkuehl/random-reddit-comment](https://github.com/connorkuehl/random-reddit-comment)
Interesting. I would (for now) abandon the Thonny - for executing your code anyway - and use the terminal to run programs. As I said, you can just launch them by navigating to the folder that contains it, and then run: python3 [python file name] substituting your file name. 
I beg to disagree with the comments that said that python is not fit for this task. I agree that by the time this idea becomes a full commercial project, it'll be in some performant language like C++. In the meantime, I think Jonikster can learn a lot and assess the feasibility of his idea using Python. There are many ways things could be sped up, from low sampling resolution (11kHZ to start), to pre-computed effects on the audio samples, or procedurally generated tones to provide the aural sound perception. At the beginning the game could be very simple with basic tones and few effects. Nothing that a good combination of Python and NumPy couldn't handle. I've seen augmented reality and OpenGL programs developed this way, with realtime image tracking and processing (on a 2007 Pentium Core) so I doubt the requirements of this task would be a problem on any semi-modern CPU. Best of luck with your project, hope to see updates soon!
Good clear descriptions, nicely done! Will you please mention how imageio.imread() makes the file readable? From what I can see in your tut, it seems to store the image as rows of color data, each representing a pixel. But I am making an assumption, and could be incorrect.
Thank you, I’m glad you found it clear to read. Ah yes that’s a good point, you’re right in your assumption, will update tomorrow to explain how the file gets read :) 
Or ghosts.
Thanks. I'm a data analyst, but would like to get transferred to a SQL Developer/ETL Engineer position in the data warehouse department. I know some SQL plus Python but I'm not sure what kind of work I should expect, so I took a look at the JIRA tickets of data warehouse department. Frankly I don't know what they use Python for, perhaps they don't use Python at all as I figured their main tool chain consists of SSIS, SSDT, SSMS and C#/VB.Net (I saw a few import tools written in .Net). Their ETL work mostly consists of: 1) Migrating data from OLTP databases (created and maintained by product engineers of other team) into data warehouse. This is probably No.1 ticket by numbers. They migrate from Vertica, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and maybe MongoDB, etc. Basically our company uses a lot of databases and all kinds of them (relational, KV, Document, you call it). 2) Import data from non-db sources, No.1 is .csv (these are mostly from the billers, very large daily dump) and I also see Excel files. I think they also import Voluum data as well. Their non-ETL work consists of: (not relevant, but I guess might be helpful) 1) Creating and maintaining Data warehouses / OLAP Cubes / Tabular Cubes 2) Writing complex queries/functions/stored procedures for clients 3) Creating web-based reporting app for easy access to reports for business users
I'm learning Python using Programming With Mosh's tutorial for beginners. I'm a freshman in HS and I'm looking to go down this field later on in life so I want to get ahead of the game now:)
Please post these threads in /r/learningpython .................
Python has no secrets. By convention, anythig beginning with a single underscore is private, but this is not enforced by the compiler or the runtime.
Pyautogui desktop automation library has this built in
It's not a matter of efficiency. Classes are used for holding states of certain "thing"s. If you want to bundle things specific into one particular container or, change similar properties of a lot of similar objects then you can consider it. They are not necessarily needed in every code, in other words you don't lose any rigor when you don't use classes. It is perfectly fine to have code without any OOP in it. But for your use case you just need to make decisions and follow certain paths. Classes just get in your way for this and you can live without them.
Thanks for your response. But your solution is barely half-baked. Right now I don't have any class as it's a simple script with only two endpoints. Your snippet means I need to convert my script to a class. But Flask is not very trivial to work inside a class. It's only adding complexity if nothing else. Also raises a lot of questions. * Where do I instantiate my app? Inside a class or outside a class? If I do it inside a class, the route decorator does not work anymore. Because `@app.route()` doesn't work any more. Neither `@self.app.route()`. * If I instantiate the app outside the class, then I have to use `flask-classful` to make the route. Which fails in a spectacular fashion for a simple `route` like `/` or `/metrics`. And for god's sake stop shoving down /r/learnpython to every question. If it's not clear not you yet, I am not learning python.
Go on! What games are using Lua for modding?

Does becoming proficient at Python automatically make you aware of every library for every purpose?
It's the sort of syntax you're likely to see looking at any given python library's source. It's a core language feature. I dunno, maybe my idea of basics is based on someone with literally any idea what programming is, but it seems pretty basic to me.
It's not enforced, but I do believe that the interpreter actually pretends the name of the cast to the function if you use the underscore withing a class definition and will not do that if you are calling it outside of the class. So, it's still not technically private because you can still call the function explicitly, but it does offer a bit of privacy for class functions.
Ok thank you

&gt; pretends the name of the cast to the function prepends the name of the class*? if so, that's when your method name begins with double underscores -- and, more importantly, it's **not to be used as an access-modifier substitute**! my friends who primarily write java or C# name all their Python methods `__like_this()` and it makes me want to claw the ol' eyes out. Its purpose is to prevent a method from being overridden during inheritance and that's the only thing it should be used for
Yea it’s fast as well. Using it in a project. There is a nice wrapper library somewhere... oh here it is https://github.com/drov0/python-imagesearch
That looks nasty... but arguably the real error is using Tkinter. I have always regreted every attempt to use it. If you need a quick UI either do a web UI or a terminal UI (e.g. using blessings, wrapper around curses).
Yeah I am also confused about the subreddits as well. I tried posting my tutorial in the "learn python" and will let you know if they allow it. &amp;#x200B;
If we understand *it's possible* to mean it can be done, then sure -- of course it can be done. The rust compiler can always generate AVX/SSE instructions. What my question was getting at is are there libraries in Rust (and to preempt a response -- no, Rayon is nowhere near there yet) that have optimized routines for linear algebra, such that the performance is in parity or better with C/C++? So, for example, if you took a dense 128x128 f64 array (the underlying implementation can be a strided 1D array) and matmul it with another, different 128x128 f64 array -- what's the performance like? 
What is "much slower?" Do you have an apples-to-apples benchmark where you disable a lot of the things pg is doing that are slowing it down?

`SyntaxError`
I disabled indexing, no primary keys were there in schema. Used copy command in postgres. It took almost forever to load 19GB file mentioned in the article. I would have waited more than 20 minutes. Then killed the process. Even the 5GB file also suffered similar fate. Maybe some configurations can be tweaked to make it go little faster but it goes against one-off analytics I have described. It simply isn't worth it considering the black box nature of DBs. Maybe you can try it. The data is free to download. 
This looks really interesting, thanks
Ndarray library in Rust is pretty good. It can be used with openblas backend too. I once benchmarked the cases in numpy library. Both gave almost similar performance. Sometimes slight statistically insignificant differences were there on both sides but I would consider them near identical. It makes sense considering numpy also had openblas backend. Strangely Rust ndarray used slightly less memory than numpy while performing dot products and matrix multiplication. Both should have been identical. I didn't test it further. 
openblas is not the fastest BLAS... if it can link to (and elegantly expose all of) MKL then it is as fast as anything. Otherwise, it can be anywhere from 2-200x slower depending on the operation.
On my laptop, pg COPY works at 150MB/s for CSV =&gt; pg. For a 5GB file, that's less than a minute. You're not doing these benchmarks on a raspberry pi, right?
That's a Tkinter issue on Mac OS, check the following link: [https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/](https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/) There you can find more information about the versions.
For some reason I am not able to pinpoint, when file size increased, time taken to import was not increasing linearly. That's why I disabled indexing and there was no primary key also. In my system HDD, the read speed hovers at around 140 MB/s. So csv import should be well below this threshold. 
If the HDD is continuously providing 140MB/s, pg must be consuming that much, otherwise the HDD would alternate between an idle and loaded state. It sounds like you managed to cause an infinite loop.
You can plug in other blas implementations also. It's just that I have tested it with openblas only. 
You misunderstood the 140MB/s. It's the upper limit of read operation in my HDD. So while importing into pg, read rate could have been much less. I didn't check that time. But the import did finished for smaller sized files. So I don't thinking there is any problem with it. I didn't understand the infinite loop in the context of csv import. It was a single big csv file. 
Ok, so the cap is 140MB/s. You can still get 150MB/s import speeds out of pg using laptop class hardware. RE: infinite loop -- if your pg is working &gt; 25x slower than mine, something is wrong. Occam's Razer suggests an infinite loop. How you make that importing a CSV, I don't know.

 instance.__hidden Doesnt work. I think what youre talking about is instance._class__hidden
Please read our sidebar.
I will check it once more. But I don't think there is any problem with the import process at all. It did work for a smaller dump with the exact same schema. Only for large sized files, I have faced this issue. It was confusing for me too that time. Maybe the upload speed is decreasing with time. It might be one possible reason. In case you are willing to test it, please let me know the time taken for all the operations I have mentioned for GitHub dump. I will also do it again. I will include this benchmark also.

The subreddits are a confused place, and a combination of low moderator activity and not a huge number of things actually happening to python in general at any given time mean that a large proportion of posts are relatively low quality or borderine off topic. There have been more than a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/avpi5h/the_purpose_of_this_subreddit/) recent [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ax3ud3/the_quality_of_this_subreddit/) about the general post quality that spotlights the problem as well.
Please read our sidebar; more specifically, check out r/learnpython
I tested it on my laptop only. The max sequential speed of a typical HDD is generally around 150MB/s only I think. 
/r/learnpython read the sidebar use an ide. pycharm and vscode are popular choices.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.

Not much point upgrading to 3.4 - it's end-of-life on Marth 17th! (details in PEP 429). I'd try for 3.7, but if there's a lot of resistance 3.6 is also great and it's the most-used version of Python at the moment. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lua-scriptable_game_engines https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lua-scripted_video_games Keep in mind I love python. I like lua a lot too. Right tool for the job. 
Again, his opinion on Python propaganda is orthogonal to the point. LPTHW is available for Py3 so that article doesn't bother me. Several of the points in the article are good criticisms, especially on ordering of topics. But they're about details and I am mostly here to defend the unorthodox approach -- in principle, they could be fixed while keeping that approach. BTW, implementing a hash table class is a great exercise for students! 
More correctly, [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) will sign your TLS/SSL certificates for free (for HTTPS or other uses) if you can demonstrate domain ownership. PythonAnywhere just wrote a guide how to use it (and also has a wild card cert for their own domain).
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?publisher=data.cityofnewyork.us&amp;res_format=JSON&amp;tags=taxi&amp;organization=city-of-new-york ^ 2017 green taxi data from there https://pastebin.com/DbUT994n 1m15s for 1.1GB csv. This is on battery power (i.e., throttled) and a pretty bad dataset -- most of the columns are fixed precision numeric types which take a lot of time to convert. Datasets with only nice types (ints, floats, ts, etc) are much faster -- parsing a NUMERIC value takes about 15 more ops than parsing a float (which is usually 2 ops). There are 19 columns -- if we assume an average of 3 ops for the 11 smallint, real, and ts columns we have 33 + 136 =&gt; 169 ops/row. This could be 57 ops/row, 24.5s for the COPY to execute. Since pg is single thread per query, this is CPU limited, and my laptop won't go above 2.5GHz on battery we could also shave 75% by using a modern i7/i9 desktop (6.125s). We could also put the file somewhere the pg core process (user postgres) can see it and use COPY proper, not \copy, which will avoid some unix sockets overhead. That's probably small though, maybe like 2%. We could also chunk the file in memory with some posix tools and run parallel queries with psql to get parallelism. For a just about worst case dataset and environment, this is ~17.5MB/s with pg copy. If your data looked like this, it would be 4.8 minutes with my laptop on battery power. The above-described desktop setup would make it slightly less than a minute.
You should really find a better ASCII symbol for black than '.', but that's just my inner art critic speaking. :p

Thank you, glad you like it!
There's runit, and s6 (for which I've made [a handy wrapper](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/ahpyq6/essex_a_high_level_command_line_frontend_to_s6/)). 
Yes you’re probably right haha, it’s one character in one line of the code to change so if you find/know of a really good one let me know! I was only really thinking of standard alphabet characters tbh but I am sure there are less usual ASCII characters that would do a better job of filling the space
So I created a thread in "LearnPython" but I can't seem to find my thread. However I didn't get a notification that it was closed, so not sure if I am just not seeing it or it indeed has been closed: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/azjuhy/lambda_and_map_function_video_tutorials_for/ Are you able to see this thread? A while ago, I used to post my beginner friendly videos in LearnPython but not sure if things have changed this past year or so. 
Maybe '#' or '@' or '█', imho. (The last one, alt-219, *might* not show up on all output devices.)
PythonAnywhere dev here -- Let's Encrypt is awesome and we're really grateful to them for providing free certs, but we've recently added an interface where we manage all of the cert issuance and renewal for you. It's just a couple of clicks to set up and then you can leave it up to us.
I think a # is a good idea, as I reckon you’re right about the last character not necessarily being the most widely available. Usually when you see ASCII art it seems to be mostly the standard characters like / \ . _ etc. so I think a # fits well with this. Will have an experiment. To those learning python and reading this: see if you can find where I set that ‘.’ character, feel free to branch my repository and alter it to a ‘#’ as a test of if you understand the code correctly. 
Fair enough. (I should clarify I don't have any real experience with python experience but have setup domains with Lets Encrypt.)
thanks man i was actually looking for it and suddenly you came in just on time Xd
You've done a good job. There are some mistakes here and there, but frankly I'm not sure I could have managed what you've accomplished myself. I appreciate your responsiveness and look forward to seeing where the project goes in the future.
I don't have an answer for your question, but I'd he interested to hear from you how screen readers work for programming (e.g. when jumping around code etc). Do you have to keep a mental model in your head of the contextual code around the current line? In particular for python, how does a screen reader convey the current indent level? I'd imagine autoformatting would have to be turned off or it would get really confusing.
It is Null value
I am an absolute beginner here so im still not understanding, apologies. why would a null value be useful here? 
There is not one solution. Would be good to realize that.

I do realise that, however as I don’t understand that solution I thought I’d try and learn from it.
/r/learnpython Quotation marks with 0 characters inside them do exactly the same as quotation marks with more than 0 characters inside them. They create a string. It's just a string with 0 characters in it (in the same way that `"a"` has one character in it). You can have 0-length lists, dicts and so on - same with strings. Also, don't use `str` as a name for variables. It clashes with the built-in `str` class. As an aside, you may be interested in the fact that as well as indexing single items from a sequence (as you're doing in the first code block), you can slice a subsequence from it (`my_sequence[1:4]`). You can also add a "step" to those subsequences, to skip some elements, [as explained here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation).
Oh okay I think I’m starting to understand, so can ‘i’ be any letter or does that represent something in python? 
You're creating an empty string, to which \`str\[i\]\` will be added in the for-loop. So for 'Hello' the result will be equal to '', 'H', 'Hl', 'Hlo' for each iteration of the loop.
The issues is that c and c++ compilers often accept utf-8, which the Greek question mark is a part of. So replacing a semicolon with a Greek question mark is not an error in text formatting like you suggested.
Oh okay I think that’s what confused me a little as well, so the ‘i’ is. String which is created in the ‘For i’ line? 
No problem! If anything is unclear feel free to let me know and happy to add explanation etc.
Thank you for showing me that subreddit I didn’t know it existed. I see so that sting is created just for later use, that does make sense. I was just using str as the exercise already labels the variable for you. And that is actually quite interesting. I will have to look into that further to fully get my head around it! Thank you for your help! 
Disney's Toontown Online and Pirates of the Caribbean Online are all written in Python.

 Well, what can I say! * Here, behold [Pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode). Oh, if it's not clear to you yet, my snippet was a Pseudocode. If you didn't get it yet, well, I don't want to hurt your feelings. * You don't even have any idea about what's inside a session object, you are copying the cookies only and you are the python master?! Who told you people only want to persist cookies only? Ever read about [Keep-Alive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive)? * While I made it clear that it's a simple script, you are forcing a solution that needs a class which is non-trivial in the context of flask. I guess you never heard of "[The zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)", master? As the zen says, Simple is better than complex. AND, you are a master. Pathetic.

while it’s cool to be able to cram all this code in one line, it really is unpythonic not to mention ugly looking
so you'd have to know what the data consists of before your execute the procedure. I think one of the reasons you find the additional quotes and what not is due to the need to account for ambiguity such as this.
Sure, but this is for human-readability, explicitly not parsing. So if Pearl in the Superintendent's office wants a hardcopy of students who have their immunizations current and one of them is `fname=Timmy, lname=Jones, III, bdate=`... she's still going to be okay with that.
Ya I know &amp;#x200B;
Anytime there's SQL involved, even under the hood, pythonicity flies out the window.
/r/learnpython read the sidebar post your code we won't do your homework for you
You said this, though: &gt;so you can more easily use regexp searches on the output. That's parsing using a regular expression. Do your thing, though. I only brought it up because I've seen folks get bit by similar thinking.
this is not a homework I'm just playing around, I edited the post now you can check the code I tried 
Now do rest of the things I told you to do. We'll know whether or not you've done them because you'll post in /r/learnpython and your code will be properly formatted for reddit.
I appreciate the warning, but it's like taking a screenshot with your phone camera -- nothing that should ever be part of automation, but a clear time saver in certain situations.

Could you post some of your Kivy GUI examples as you mentioned? Private message them if you'd like, but I'm quite curious to see some examples.
If you use \`pip install\`, the \`Pipfile\` doesn't get updated so you're not in the \`pipenv\` environment... you might want to learn what the difference is.
If you're already in the virtual env, both will do the same except \`pipenv install\` will also update your Pipfile.
Correct. I just didn't realize PythonAnywhere made it that easy to use Let's Encrypt.
To explain the harsh response: this sub is hit all day every day by posts which don't belong here, by folks who don't bother to read the sub's info before posting, which can be frustrating. All day, every day. 
I see, thank you very much for that answer. In wich cases you wouldnt want to update your Pipfile? i can imagine a few scenarios but i would like know how people with experience do it
Thank you! I will learn the difference!
If you have a list of points you can do the following: 1. Compute the distance between it and itself with scipy.spatial.distance.cdist. The result is an MxM square array. 2. Suppress the diagonal values (make them 1e99 or something), since they are 0. 3. Compute the minimum across the first dimension - this is the distance between a point and any other point. In other words, it is a measure for how close each point is to any other one in the cloud. 4. Calculate the zscore or some other metric over these points. Clip values with nsigma &gt; 5 or something. This works really really well, but might get slow for really big point clouds (say, 100,000 pts or bigger). It works in single digit ms for clouds below 1,000 points.
I have been working on an xkcd download script for the past few days. Just finished working script. &amp;#x200B; Right now it starts with the most recent and works its way back in time.

I did a similar project for my Java class! It turned out super well, except I wanted a 1:1 converter and the images were only viewable in a 1 pt monospace font. They did look beautiful though
I usually do the pip install when I’m testing a third party lib, but not sure if it fits my needs. If it does, I uninstall it from pop and do a full pipenv install. If it doesn’t, then I just uninstall it. You could do just pipenv install for testing a package, but IMHO, it’s not worth the lock-and-sync wait for every module you try.
Thats what i thought, thank you!

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7.

rows in your code is a list. You can do dot notation but you have to do it on the individual row not the list. (Assuming everything else is correct here). I took out "i" since you shouldn't need to do that, rows is iterable already. for row in rows: x.add_row([ row.first_name, row.last_name, row.tel_num ])

Thanks for the numbers. I think these numbers makes sense. But you can see that the Rust program took totally 4 mins to read, group by, join 4 files amounting 30GB in my HDD. It had an average CPU usage of 50% making it I/O bound. This was exactly my point in the blog. There were situations where I had to deal with 100s of GB(still on laptop) and it's such a pleasure to use Rust to do the processing. C++/C also will achieve the same. But I am more at home in Rust despite being relatively new at it. 
Maybe look into using re.compile to compile the regular expression? It might speed the processing up a little
Installing a custom version that's not the distro's will be another pain point that your colleagues can push back with. ANY python &gt;3.3 will be a great huge step up over the current version 2. Just use the latest version that is the least painful to upgrade to.
Like a word example?, is that what you're looking for?
Our year old Linux LTS cluster uses Python 2.7. 3. My boss got mad our software doesn’t support a version despite our official version being 2.7.8 and hasn’t been updated in 5 years. Uh...you can setup our CI system to run the tests, but I don’t support &lt;2.7.7 and haven’t for years. After trying for an hour, we just installed a modern version.
My point was largely that you can speed this up tremendously -- even still on laptop hardware -- and that this is a pretty worst-case example for pg performance. For example, your 4 files could be COPY'd in parallel. And if your CPU works at more than 2.5Ghz, you should outpace this anyway. Or if your data isn't almost 50% fixed-width numeric types. Which, in your post, it isn't. The transformations and reductions will fly in postgres. It's not uncommon to have queries like that come back in &lt; 5 ms on millions of rows. I would anticipate only a handful of seconds for pg to answer your query once the data is loaded. And, of course, if this isn't a total throw-away and some (or all) of that data will be reused, the data backing the pg query will persist in that format and not require reloading. (It will have to page from disk, but not be interpreted which is where all the cycles are spent). Plus, of course, you get the zillion creature comforts of an sql database. There's nothing wrong with doing this in Rust. But your bespoke solutions don't have any frills. That alone will largely explain performance. Beyond that, the pg copy I demonstrated is about 169 ops per row. The data in your post is a few strings and an int -- &lt; 10 ops per row. So you should expect &gt; 16x higher performance out of pg. Since my example chewed at ~17MB/s, you would hit the storage bottleneck of 140MB/s with pg's single thread.
IndyPy representing... Great meetup group. 
I will do it today on pg again and let you know. You used postgres with default settings?
Any package worth using supports or supported python 2 and 3 until maybe just recently. It has tests and those tests run in python 2 and 3. The new versions will support python 3 only, so the bug fixes will not be applied to python 2.
For the past three days, I've been building a linux-friendly server-side virtual assistant that uses `multiprocessing`, `asyncio`, `speech_recognition`, and a bunch of bootstrapped utilities that I've been working on for the past year. It's been a positively gargantuan undertaking but I can finally see the finish line.
postges.app // postgresql 10.7 with nothing tweaked. psql through bash
That was my first time hearing about groundwork. I don't see how its better than standard [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) or [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/).
Done.
I actually tried to delete it after many hours as I couldn't find my post. Eerily, it sort of disappeared into a vacuum. I might have deleted it accidentally AFTER many hours as I was trying to confirm it exists. I then tried to post the same video link in Python, and it also disappeared so I am not sure if my privileges have been suspended? I will test again tomorrow. I don't quite understand how subreddits work in this case, but do moderators work for free? If so it's a lot of work to maintain a subreddit. They would just create another subreddit, but who would maintain it? I think it's only going to get worse in terms of mix-mash of all types of threads being created. Python has grown a lot this past couple of years. However this is a problem in other programming languages subreddits as well like Swift etc. Machine learning subreddit is a little better, but there are still odd questions that get a lot of votes. 
Yeah, that. I don’t know what Anglo-Saxon English looks like and didn’t want to try it out just to see if I’d find it interesting. A couple things which would improve it: - pause before stopping the recording to give people time to read the translation before it loops - add a new line after translating so it doesn’t look like the king gave the knight a MacBook Pro as well. 😜

1. Yeah, I'll do that 2. I can't seem to find a solution for that &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Why not let `repr` handle the messy work for you? '\n'.join(repr(dict(r)) for r in connection.execute(table.select())) Or use csv (admittedly not one line but definitely pythonic)? buffer = io.StringIO() writer = csv.DictWriter(buffer, table.columns) writer.writeheader() writer.writerows(connection.execute(table.select())) print(buffer.getvalue())
As someone that writes Python professionally on a daily basis and interacts with SQL on an almost daily basis, I fundamentally challenge your assertion.
You’re already outputting a new line after “insert phrase here:” so whatever you did there (a simple `print(“”)` statement?), do the same before the program exits. 
Because I wanted to search through the output with a text editor, like `/fname=Timmy,[^;]* age=10` instead of `/'fname': 'Timmy'[^}] 'age': 10`and yes I realize it's a trivial difference but when my brain is full it's easier.
Lol... They were images used for AWS Rekognition tutorials. Forgot to close them.

Write code. Post code on github.
If 99% of what you do with R can be done in Excel, it means you didn't find the proper problems to solve. With R you can open millions of excel files, read the data, analyse it and condense it to a plot or a new file. Excel is good at solving some problems, R, python at solving others. If you are so comfortable with Excel, you should try to find a way of making money with it (I know people who does!) and along the wat, one day you will cross a problem you can't solve and start digging into R or Python...

Absurdly low.
I think it will be a great idea to use the concept of both R and Python in a single Project . we know both these language has their own limitation and Advantage. if we use the concept of both the language then we can over come both the limitation which will be a great thing. This will make our project more productive and efficient. For this we should firstly gain good knowledge and [skills on Python](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-diploma-in-python-course-in-delhi/) and R Language.
Write code. Add open source license. Upload somewhere (github will do, or whatever you fancy). Tell people about it.

The description of that sub-reddit is quite clear: &gt;Subreddit for posting questions and asking for general advice about your python code. While the description of this sub-reddit is: &gt;news about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python I believe this kind of posts fits better the latter description...
Thanks in the end I used concurrent.futures as it seemed easier.
This is plain wrong, languages are not interpreted or compiled per se but implementations of them are. PyPy is a popular Python implantation that is not an interpreter but a JIT compiler. Besides, you can perfectly develop a game with CPython with PyGame or Panda3D, or any other engine with Python bindings for that matter. So, while is true that current Python implementations are slower than say a C compiler like gcc for most tasks, arguments that Python is unsuitable for game development from first principles alone are wrong, specially when founded on a conceptual confusion.
Hey, before you will reply for this post you can check pros and cons of Python Web Development, what is devs hourly rate and the most important is how to [hire python developers](https://mobilunity.com/blog/hire-python-developer/) for affordable prices. I'm sure you will enjoy it!

Obviously I did that. With integer it was shower than this.11 mins. There are no headers in csv file. 
Getting data from TSheets
Keeping all columns as text was the fastest import with 8 mins and 46 seconds. 
I'm in the same industry and want to learn more about python. I have no prior experience. Did you learn from the books or did you have some basic knowledge which we enhanced by these books?
Same on Safari (iOS 12)
Trying to work through the Udemy crash course. Hoping to figure out how to interact with APIs and grab data. &amp;#x200B; Ideally I'm looking to create some code that will notify me when new buy orders are placed on tokens I hold over at Etherdelta/Forkdelta to save myself time checking a bunch of URLs.
Unfortunately I dont think it's possible. Because the qr code can be used to provide information. But unless you have a custom app that you scan the qr code with you wouldn't be able to send out an email using the persons device.
Some information about how it works would be nice. You write Python code. OK. What's deployed to the browser and runs there? What runs on the server? What does the Rust code do?
If what you want to do is have *other* people scan and then receive (or send) an sms or email, you would need to distribute an app to provide that capability. All QR codes do is encode text/bytes. If what you want is to scan a QR code *yourself* and then have an email or sms sent on your behalf, you just need to find an email and sms provider and use their APIs to send the mesages.
more suited to r/learnpython
Is the db on your hard drive? My intuition is that pg is dumping to disk often and making the HDD seek which is well known to be very slow. If that’s not the case, you’re getting really Abysmal read speeds out of copy...
No, but thank you for pointing it out. We have been sticking with Tek's VISA because a piece of wireless test equipment we have requires it (at least we haven't gotten around to trying to use the Tek equipment with another version of VISA).
Oh thank god! I thought the game engine ran on web-assembly! For a second, I thought you compiled python for web-assembly and then wrote a game engine on it. Then I read the linked documentation and sighed with relief!
Got it. Thanks!
Anytime! Happy hacking :)
By hard drive, you mean external disk? No. It's not. But everything including DB and data is on HDD only. Integer, Text, integer, Text with this setup. I got 8 mins import(fastest one yet). And that's just for 5GB file. In the same HDD, simple Rust iterative code finished everything in about 4 mins. Anyway this is why I tend to avoid DBs for one time processing/analysis. It's easy to reason about performance of iterative code or even spark for that matter. I tend to go for DBs only when I know I have to do multiple frequent analysis. 
No, I mean HDD. If you read and write to one at the same time the performance tends to be terrible. 
&gt; with no compilation I think this means that you write python code which does not have to be compiled. The rust has been compiled already.
Yeah I got it. Here that was the problem when I was noticing iotop during the process. 
From my understanding: &gt; What's deployed to the browser and runs there? A python interpreter, written in rust, which is compiled to webassembly. &gt; What runs on the server? Nothing in particular, necessarily - it could just serve static files (a webassembly blob, in this case). &gt; What does the Rust code do? Gets compiled once down to a webassembly python interpreter.
 What you wrote, in the first paragraph, has two sentences. Only in the second sentence you qualify what you say regarding OP's question. The first sentence contains a blanket statement about Python's performance founded on a categorical mistake, attributing the properties that corresponds to an implantation to the language itself and at the same time makes two false assertions. You are giving a somewhat correct answer to OP about the viability of his project but for the wrong reasons and spreading the myth that Python \*per se\* is slow and given this unsuitable for making videogames.
Worked perfect thank you so much!
Is the translation gramatically correct?
Why don't you give them a mandatory position for the optional parameters? (not sure of the terminology) .e.g.: def my_func(arg1, *, a, b, c):
there's no division by zero here (regardless of whether it's Python) -- it's already ignoring zero values. If planWertExt is 0 then it will return 0.0 without doing the division.
&gt; I don't want to get into a whole explanation of what that means or why it is, so let me just answer your question 
I think that those random UTF-8 characters are allowed in variable names. I could be wrong, so feel free to let me know.
Garry's Mod is the one I'd recommend. There's near endless community produced content for you to learn from and mod.
So there's obviously a bunch of really mature validation libraries out there already. The motivation for TypeSystem is that I need a package that: &amp;#x200B; * Offers really great support for \*either\* using it for API validation, \*or\* for form rendering. * Really comprehensive marshalling of data types to/from JSON schema, so you can easily auto-document the input and outputs of an API. * Has the ability to map validation errors onto which line/column numbers they occured at within a JSON or YAML document.
Pretty cool! Next step would be to export the results to something like a csv/json. 
What sort of code are you trying to run? If it’s something simple then you might be able to get away with an app like SoloLearn, Which has a built in Python interpreter 
[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) has a free tier and is a pretty decent browser-based solution.
Unfortunately is not that simple, some of the code uses APIs from external websites and also files and resources hosted on the pc
&gt;if scrollbar = down: &gt; &gt;scrollbar = up Boom. Done. I'll send you the bill.
I saw that but I was looking for something which lets me use the resources on my PC at home, I really don't want to host my private files elsewhere
I’m not sure then man, Good luck!
Well the cloud or a remote desktop solution like Teamviewer are kind of your only choices. Out of curiosity, given that hundreds of millions of people host their files on various cloud services, why are you so reluctant?
You should add a sample report to your package description.
The range varies between backups of films that I own and financial documents
Very cool

But.... none of those things have anything to do with you practicing Python. You don't have to move your whole hard drive to the cloud.... Maybe you should be a little clearer about what it is you're trying to do with Python that you want to do remotely, because now I'm very confused.
This is cool. Thanks!
I think i would, even that it only supports spec 2.0 as ``connexion`` forces me to write the ``yaml, or json``. ``fastapi`` looks also good but it seams to be only a api framework maintained by one person. I'm not a big fan of django as it is too big (admin interface, own orm not sqlalchemy, own template language, ...) 
Neat! It actually scrapes the page rather than using the public API?
Interesting. Reminds me of how the 5 GHz channel on my router went out last month and hasn't come back, but there's a chance StarHub might end up giving us yet another router some time down the road.

I believe this only works if you configure your domain to point to PythonAnywhere hosting. If it does, then it's straightforward for PythonAnywhere to demonstrate domain control to Let's Encrypt.
If you try pyvisa-py, it would be very nice to know the outcome! For a lot of applications I've been stuck with NI-VISA and slowly moving away... 
Anything will work. Like, literally, any laptop newer than 2005.
I'm still learning Python (on Codecademy, as that's what someone recommended me to use), but am trying to work on a project when I have the time (as I'm quite busy with other personal stuff). An open-source software stack for e-readers, built from the ground up, but aims to be compatible with and even rip some code from the popular Calibre e-book library software. I could've forked it, but it's written in Python 2, and I want to use Python 3!! In the past, I've had quite a lot of failed projects (mostly DIY type stuff), so I've decided to use a working title and eventually hold a contest to come up with the name and visual identity some time down the road. For now, that working title is "Project Barry". It was originally part of a hardware project I'm also working on, codenamed "Poirot", but I decided to create the software before the hardware, and make the software a separate, open-source platform, that would eventually be part of a bigger thing if I can achieve my dreams. I know I could've based the software on Android, but doing so would require me to code in Java, which is too complicated for me to understand. Currently, **I do not have a working prototype of it yet**, which is why I haven't formally announced it. I may file an issue with Calibre to see if the developers plan to start a new GIT branch for development of a new version based on Python 3, and possibly PySide (instead of PyQt).

I'm assuming he wrote the rust code that compiles the python code into web assembly, so you would be able to code a game in python that would be able to run in a browser 
This sounds great! Looks like code is somewhat similar to pygame, with a little "cruft" removed &amp;#x200B; Is it possible to have an in-browser text-editor in which we can type some python, then press "run" to give it a go?
I could be wrong or we could be saying the same thing, but I was under the impression that he used rust to write the python-&gt;web assembly, So you could write python that gets turns into web assembly and is run in the browser 
Make sure you're using the rewrite branch. The master/async branches don't work with python 3.7
I've got python scripts that execute/modify or interact with my local files, how could I host the scripts in the cloud and interacting with the files on my PC at the same time?
If you like Jupyter then perhaps google colab could work? [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
Why are you stuck with NI-VISA? You probably already know this, but Tek and Rohde don't charge for their VISA libraries / packages on Windows. [https://www.tek.com/support/faqs/what-tekvisa-0](https://www.tek.com/support/faqs/what-tekvisa-0)
Your current laptop will work. Using Linux or MacOS will probably yield a better experience but I might be wrong since I haven't checked the state of things on Windows in a long time.
Python violates the Zen left and right. The Zen itself violates the Zen. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules, but being Dutch is special enough to be a special case special enough to break the rules. That's all fine, as long as you consider the Zen the joke that it is; the sad part is that people are taking it seriously somehow.
It’s definitely (largely) a joke, though generally not bad to have in mind
Yes, that's exactly right -- we have to prove that we are the host for the domain before we can get a certificate. They've got a couple of ways for us to prove that; the one we use is based on HTTP. Basically, we send them a message saying "we'd like a certificate for www.example.com", and they respond saying "OK -- make a page available at http://www.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/X with the content Y", both X and Y being long random strings that they specify. We set things up so that that URL works and contains the appropriate content, and then they make requests to that URL from their servers to make sure that everything is correct. Once they've confirmed to their satisfaction that we really do host the site, they send us the certificate. The protocol is called ACME (kind of backronymed to Automated Certificate Management Environment) and [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment) has some good links if you're interested in the details. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Just lack of time and the requirement of not breaking things :-) 
Same here!
On the subject of Python on mobile, I found an android app called QPython3 that allowed me to write and run code pretty well.
its actually a great library i used to use it in my Project its a powerfull machine learning library (Opencv).
Looking at the comments, I think your description of the process and all should be made a little clearer.
Yes! My original reason for doing so was that I wanted it to be "plug-and-play" and didn't want users to have to navigate the token process so that they could use the script. Unfortunately, I just now realized after reading your comment that anyone with enough savviness to clone the repo and make sure the script's dependencies are installed could probably figure the token thing out without much trouble at all. &amp;#x200B; Oh well, good practice with BeautifulSoup.
The biggest offenders are usually including API keys or user information in source code or tests. That stuff should be stored in config files outside of version control.
Ok..thank you.
ok..tx u.
That isn't a bug. It's a *very* well-known consequence of the cpython object system that has been discussed time and time again and is probably mentioned on this sub at least once a week if not more often. Thankfully, building an empty list with `[]` is faster than any other operation except an identity comparison or the loading of a local or const, so there is no point to store a list in function.__defaults__.
I know this game, but I don't know which programming language was used to develop
In order to run python scripts "in the cloud" which can access "local" files (on your computer) you're going to need to turn your computer into a server. If your ISP doesn't give you a static IP then you'll need to get some kind of dynamic IP forwarding service. Assuming you have a static IP of say `1.2.3.4` then you'll need to set up your router to forward whichever ports you want to open up over to your actual computer that you're running the server on. This can be complicated or easy, depending on your router. Now if you've done all of this then you've essentially created your own "cloud" and you don't need to run python in "someone else's cloud." The only thing is, you will have one of the most insecure web servers in the world unless you take extra precaution locking your network down. Remember that opening up your network to the outside world means that the door is visible to anyone who would care to check. There's no hacker sitting there looking for your specific IP address, but there are hackers sitting there constantly scanning any and every IP address looking for an insecure webserver like yours. If you don't want other people to be able to log into your computer and get access to your personal files then you'll need to read up on securing a server. There's basic things you can do to secure your server up to the point where you're not the worse server. You know that joke about running away from a bear and how you just need to be faster than the slowest guy? Yeah, securing a server is kinda like that. You're never going to build an impenetrable server, and the best you can do is to access your threats and determine what can and can't be mitigated. You say your films and financial documents are the most important things, so after you set up a firewall and so on, you'll probably want to look into data encryption. But once you get this done, you'll probably want to set up some automation to keep your webserver up to date. You'll want to at the very least download and install security patches. I didn't mention it yet, but you're probably way better off setting up a Linux server instead of a Windows one. And phew, that's all just to get the server up and running. You're probably going to want an automatically backup solution as well, if you don't already have one. If you don't wanna remember your IP address you can get a domain name and forward it.
Then the problem is just because pg is writing to disk and your rust program is not... up pg’s memory limit and decrease write frequency in the conf and it will be much faster...
yes
But hey, on the bright side, if you’ve done all this and can demonstrate that you did it well and understand what you’re doing then congrats! You are now qualified for jobs with job titles like “sysadmin,” “network admin,” “Linux admin,” and so on. That’s pretty awesome because these jobs pay bank for relatively easy work. Downside though is these people are typically on call like 24/7. My uncle does something like this and I think he told me that he rotates 24/7 call duty with another guy and that during the times he’s on call he basically can’t go anywhere and needs to be ready to boot up a computer on the spot and fix whatever issues come up.
Does not work on Firefox Quantum 65.0.2 (64-bit)
Wow thanks for the esaustive reply. At this point I think I'll buya laptop down the road to use TeamViewer.
Read the sidebar.
You store "variable" value (btw, it's good to change the name to something more descriptive like is_locked) in your function and then run the script. But this value is not saved anywhere after the script ends running - python (and most other programming languages) keep variable state in memory during runtime. What you need can be solved in many ways: - run the program indefinitely with while loop (but then you can still stop Python and everything will work like in the beginning) - keep "variable" value on hard drive and read it before asking the question to user. You can use Python's pickle module, serialize it to JSON or other format or store in database. Mind you if user can access this storage he'll still be able to change it. But I guess it's not a problem for now ;)
I'm not sure what you are trying to do here, but at minimum the formatting is off &amp;#x200B; def start(): print("Hello Mr, how are you? ") x = input() variable = False if x == "I'm fine thank you." and variable == False: print("That's nice to hear, welcome to your computer. ") else: print("""\033[1;32;41mThe password was wrong, you are not the real Mr. This is now locked forever, Hahahaha\n""") variable = True start() &amp;#x200B; Formatted like this the program works fine for me. It will never save the state if the password is incorrect, it will just print the wrong password message and set the variable to True, but the function ends like that the the variable is just thrown out. If you are trying to have an authentication routine, that's a more complicated problem which would involve saving the result of the password check to someplace probably a file or a database. In this case the variable will always be false when the function is called.
1. /r/learnpython 2. If by "locked forever" you mean "locked between runs of the function", use a global variable. If you mean "locked between runs of your entire program", that's effectively impossible on a user-controlled computer.

Strangely it does if you keep refreshing. I thought it was a uBlockO issue so I was enabling and disabling things until it suddenly worked when I went back to my initial config.
What phone do you have? If iOS there is the Pythonista app. It’s a full python ide and environment, and you’d be able to transfer whichever files you need to your phone locally. It does autocomplete and is pretty neat. I don’t use it much, but other people have gotten pip and such to install on it. It’s $20 I think, but it’s IMO worth it. (Though if that’s too much, search for the app developer’s Twitter page. He has a sticky tweet with a link to the TestFlight beta for Pythonista that anyone can sign up for. It gets you a free version of the app that will work for as long as the dev keeps letting people beta test.)
Yeah! I have never heard of "BeautifulSoup", but I now think I will be using that in a future project of mine, along with the sources used by "PageFlip" (a real app on Android) (as Python seems to include a JSON interpreter module), in addition to RSS feeds, and possibly directly partnering with webcomic services to be able to directly access those through private APIs not exposed in the would-be source code.
Well, too bad.. you will never know what you are missing out.

I got Android unfortunately, I never used Jupiter notebook but I'll look into it with the Google implementation
great article, it never occurred to me to use data classes the way they are illustrated here. now i've got some ideas on how to apply them in the code i'm working on. 
Everything that requires additional hardware has a pretty hefty initial outlay, yes ... even the smart plugs are ~$40-$60 EACH ... I grew this huge automation mess over a few years - I think I started with just ~$200 of Hue stuff - probably a 3 pack of white bulbs, and a starter kit with a bridge and 2 coloured bulbs. Then I added and added and added from there. All together, now, with one dead bridge included (it had a good life), I've probably got ~$1040 in Hue stuff in this house! (Wow, I've never totalled that up before!) ... add the Pi, the Insteon bridge and sensors, and the smart plugs and I have no doubt I'm at or over $2000 - but that built up very, very slowly over like 6 years now. Has it saved me $2000 in electricity? Not a chance - but did I have a hell of a fun time coding it, learn a lot, and absolutely LOVE it damn near every time I walk into a room and the lights come on? Hell yes! And THAT makes it worth it to me! I've spent money on so many things in my life - game consoles, games, phones and tablets, musical instruments, books, appliances, food, clothes, etc., etc., etc. - not a single one of those things has kept me smiling for an entire 6 years - not one. The cash to satisfaction and pride ratio of all this automation, for me, is absolutely mind boggling :)
Good luck man. Jupyter is just you can think of as Python in a browser, it’s not a special obscure thing. If you have used the python repl or terminal etc then the only thing that’s different is that it’s in a browser. Just saying this so you don’t think you have to learn yet another complicated tool. Google should have lots of example notebooks to learn from
AWS has a lot of developer positions that are remote, I believe.
Your variable is always False for the portion that matters, the content of variable is always initialized to False every time start is called. The value of variable doesn't get saved between successive runs of start. 
Mornings be like, I'm going to procrastinate studying by taking picture of my study setup I'm not using
I've gone down this rabbit hole with a similar project idea. I have 350 QR codes spread around 4 million square feet of buildings my company manages the operations of, I track them in a Google Form that they are linked to. There's no Python involved, but Google has a great ecosystem already in place. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfwJB5QKMWM) on how to set up the QR codes. Check it out and see if there is a way to have alerts set up through Google whenever a value is entered into the Google Spreadsheet (meaning someone scanned a QR code) and the person will know you've scanned it.
I learned Python because I was bored and I liked to solve problems. As for why learn to code, it leads to some of the highest compensated professional work on the market. Also code is the backbone of pretty much everything now. The example I always use is Instagram - acquired for 1 billion for a team of twelve with something like 100 million users (they used a Python backend). You can only get that kind of ratio of people to impact with software.
Cool idea to compare licenses.
It doesn't work on Firefox Quantum either.
This is by design
Of course, they didn’t `rot13` it by accident. But it is funny
Can I ask what library you're using to read the spreadsheet? Are you doing any writing to another spreadsheet? 
What are the specs on the machines and what is CPU and memory utilization at run time outside of Python?
Using pandas.read_excel. Yes, I am also using to_excel to write to another spreadsheet. 
A Python game engine written in Rust that compiles to WebAssembly? You're either a genius, a maniac, or both. I may need to investigate a little more to figure out which.
Python philosophy (In interpreter type "import this".) Use a decent framework and or settle on an established type of architecture. Besides that a lot of security issues and such are related to credentials in code, not validating filtering user input, not keeping up with security patches for underlying OS, libraries tools etc... BUT the real achilles heel of any system is the people. Stupid passwords, reusing passwords, easily manipulated etc..
Is the spreadsheet very large? Like, bigger-than-memory on either of the machines? Pandas handles that case differently, and the speed difference can be noticeable.
It looks like pandas has a couple of options for "engine", it should default to using openpyxl for both operating systems, I just know that using different excel writers tend to have very different performance. Are both versions of pandas the same? For that matter, is the version of python the same? 
"scary things"? wat?
Cloud automation with Python + Salt.
Thanks. Do you have any perspective on how to really measure the top PyPI packages? It seems CI drives much of the traffic, which must tilt the balance toward packages used by projects with alot of dependencies and heavy CI use. 
It's a lot of good advice, especially for beginners, but being a good software developer is knowing when to disregard that advice. I try to stick to the advice whenever practical, but it's typically the first thing to fly out the window. It's like PEP8, a good set of guidelines but not the end all, be all.
It's probably something businesses send employees to rather than for private individuals. Can't imagine paying the price of a used car to learn all that
What's the processor in each? You named two widely varying brand names.

Its awesome
"flat is better than nested" gets me everytime. I'd like to see you create any sense of complexity using nothing but single loops and operators: no double for loops, no if inside if, . The very first piece of code I wrote was to draw cubes placed on the points of a grid in Maya. The only feasible way to do that is with a nested for loop. 
Well you could save to and import from a file, or create a system variable :D
This always reminds me of 'Desiderata' https://www.desiderata.com/desiderata.html
Have you considered creating your own? [There are various libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries.html) you could use, and it would make for a good learning experience.
Sounds like either a school project, or wanting free labor....
it's meaning is a bit less literal than just nested for-next loops. It could also apply to using composition as opposed to inheritance when composing classes, for example.
Not to mention, Google yields some good results that probably wouldn't need any updating to bring it all the way up to the most recent version of Python.
What would be more interesting if "old packages" were Python 2 only packages, like the py3 progress report: http://py3progress.begg.digital/

I don't even consider it good advice; it's more like cute, pseudo-deep, after-the-fact musing about the ideas that went into Python's design. But they are too vague to be used as actual advice, unless accompanied by lengthy explanations and context. Most of it is also relatively useless because it talks about decisions that are tradeoffs, but does so in a simple black-and-white manner. Sure, simple is better than complex, but the choice one is usually confronted is rather one between different kinds of complexity, some of them hidden, and the art is to pick the one that is easiest to manage.
I've used voluptuous and marshmallow a little bit. My main care about is serialization and not just validation. What I'd really love, is something as powerful as Rust's serde, for example - [all the options available for handling unions](https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html) - [flattening](https://serde.rs/attr-flatten.html) for reusable schema elements Even better if someone finds a way to tie this into type annotations.
Hi guys, I'm learning python and this is my first "completed" project. At work I have to send our client a list of what was done that day, so we create a new list every day where we drag the tickets into. At the end of the day I run this script, and paste it into an email to the client. It totally suits my needs! Github: [https://github.com/DessoCode/pyExportTrelloList](https://github.com/DessoCode/pyExportTrelloList) Please give me feedback of how shitty my code is. But it totally works for me!
This sounds like a huge project. You seem analytical enough to finish it. Good luck, Pythonista.
Obviously you should just write a generator to output the next coordinate tuple and iterate over it just once. So much cleaner. /s

You realize you could easily refactor this into like... 2 lines, right? 
Were gonna need more than that. However did you have the __init__ function return something? Why?
Have you looked at [repl.it](https://repl.it)? It may meet your needs.
I prefer National Lampoon's Deteriorata: Go placidly Amid the noise and waste. And remember what comfort there may be In owning a piece thereof. Avoid quiet and passive persons Unless you are in need of sleep. Rotate your tires. Speak glowingly of those greater than yourself And heed well their advice, Even though they be turkeys. Know what to kiss... and when! Consider that two wrongs never make a right But that three... do. Wherever possible, put people on hold. Be comforted that in the face of all aridity and disillusionment And despite the changing fortunes of time, There is always a big future in computer maintenance. [Chorus] You are a fluke Of the universe. You have no right to be here. And whether you can hear it or not The universe is laughing behind your back. Remember the Pueblo. Strive at all times to bend, fold, spindle and mutilate. Know yourself. If you need help, call the FBI. Exercise caution in your daily affairs, Especially with those persons closest to you. That lemon on your left, for instance. Be assured that a walk through the ocean of most souls Would scarcely get your feet wet. Fall not in love therefore; It will stick to your face. Gracefully surrender the things of youth: The birds, clean air, tuna, Taiwan And let not the sands of time Get in your lunch. Hire people with hooks. For a good time call 606-4311; Ask for "Ken." Take heart amid the deepening gloom That your dog is finally getting enough cheese. And reflect that whatever misfortune may be your lot It could only be worse in Milwaukee. [Chorus] Therefore, make peace with your god Whatever you conceive him to be- Hairy thunderer, or cosmic muffin. With all its hopes, dreams, promises and urban renewal The world continues to deteriorate. GIVE UP!
Nope. Show me!
they exist but can be tough to find. Good luck!

But... your example board... it was a joke... :'(
Hahah I thought you were actually serious man :D Phew! &amp;#x200B;
If you can't find a compelling list of reasons to learn Python that anyone attending can understand, you should reconsider being a teacher.
When you take a step back it's kind of neat to see the miniature "arms race" between technologies and counter technologies sometimes. While it might not be intentional, the threat of "deepfaking" is probably accelerating the development of these kinds of things which could have some pretty cool application!

On the one hand, obviously, a technology like deepfakes are damaging to lives and potentially systems such as trust and governments. But on the other hand, as you mentioned, sometimes there needs to be an adversary or villain type to push us to address those cases we otherwise wouldn't

&gt; deepfakes are damaging to lives and potentially systems such as trust and governments. Well, *can* be. The technology itself isn't necessarily damaging. [This](https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-30-at-3-52-33-pm.png?resize=952,600) picture alone is proof that there are good uses for it.
That's great but it seems the method he is using (image classification using CNN) is not the most adequate.
What about itertools.product?
Luckily itertools.product will do that. You were saying?
Python is not a compiled language, so it does not need a compiler. If you're looking for an interpreter, there's basically only one choice outside of niche use cases, and it's CPython, the thing you download from Python.org. Or are you looking for an IDE?
To be honest I'm not well versed enough to tell you. Just took a couple college courses in c# and want to use Python because it reads better and performs the same if not better
To be honest I'm not well versed enough to tell you. Just took a couple college courses in c# and want to use Python because it reads better and performs the same if not better
OK, question then: would you call Visual Studio a C# compiler? Also, don't expect C# levels of performance from Python. If you're doing compute heavy stuff, Python _will_ be slower.
I would yes. That's what I was told at least. Also nothing heavy. I'm not good I mostly make simple applications for my own varying uses in console.
Then download Python 3.7 from Python.org, and then download [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
Thank you much, cheers m8!
You can handle nested data without nested code. 
That's definitely a thing. In the last company I worked with, we had a data analyst that was working remotely from rural Virginia. Friend of mine works remotely as data analyst / scientist for a famous European startup. As far as I know, the tools they use the most are SQL and Python.
Those jobs usually exist because of personal connections. Usually it means both sides know each other and a re comfortable with a remote workplace. If I was looking for that job, I focus my search on my past co workers/bosses and ask around. I know that post those jobs quite often on the job boards, but usually they have inside candidates and the posts are more about filling hr checkbox vs doing a real open search.

You can definitely do it with Paramiko. Look into the `exec_command` method.
What are some better suited methods?
Could go on r/sbubby
that too is the Zen of Python 
Can we create a python .so module with Rust as we could create with Cython?
It doesn't work. exec_command gets stuck when running "sudo su - username" and doesn't return. For example, the following code never gets to the second print. import paramiko import time cli = paramiko.client.SSHClient() cli.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.client.AutoAddPolicy()) cli.connect(hostname="192.168.0.100", username="myusername", password="mypassword") print("Running su") stdin_, stdout_, stderr_ = cli.exec_command("sudo su - differentuser") print("ran SU") stdout_.channel.recv_exit_status() lines = stdout_.readlines() for line in lines: print(line) cli.close()
You don't seem to understand the point. It's called "Zen" for a reason. Just like Ten Commandments for religious people, these set of principles that are nice to know and follow but of course everyone knows life often gets more complex than that. Nobody is saying that these are set of legal rules that everyone must follow at every step. They are far too general. But keeping these in the back of mind helps when one is faced with design decisions. It helps you to avoid getting too clever with your code (explicit better than implicit), ensuring readability always counts, handling errors properly etc. I've seen far too many software projects fail because experienced developers simply fail to adhere to these simple principles and the code became an unmaintainable mess. 
I wish they went more functional and creative. Like I think we should have like a codegolf or obfuscation challenge for this.
Hold on. You said you need to run one command, right? Why are you trying to do it in interactive mode, especially with ugliness like `sudo su`?
He wrote a game engine in rust, that interprets python (like Unity uses C# as an example). He uses WASM as a target, for the browser to be able to run it.
Yeah, our work setup is pretty odd. I need to "sudo su - username" before being able to issue further commands to restart some service. I think switching user is something that these libraries don't really enjoy
Do you actually understand what that command does? What is the command you're _really_ trying to run? 
Doesn't your example play in favour of it though? You pick out the "simple is better than complex" line. The next line says "complex is better than complicated" which ties in to your more realistic example problem. Personally, I think it does a good job of demonstrating the philosophy of how you should approach the language, all couched in a series of statements that read like zen koans but shouldn't be held in any sort of reverence. They aren't meant to be explicit design rules. If you want to take the zen angle, there is no one right answer to something, but there is a right answer for each person (or more relevant to python, each project). These statements help you reach your right answer. So you have generic advice that's wrapped up to make it seem meaningful, but in doing so makes you think on how that advice applies to your project, so does in fact have some meaning to it. That's how I see the joke of it anyway.
...is that Nicholas Cage's face overlayed on some lady?
There is no 'H' in Nicolas Cage. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage | http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/
Haha yes, it opens a new shell under that user name. "sudo su - newuser" is the first command to type and cannot be done any differently, unfortunately. I really wish I could so a simple "sudo su newuser", but unfortunately I NEED to create a new shell. The reasons aren't so relevant since I have no way of changing the behaviour
Why do you need to create a new shell? This is actually important. Also, why can't you create a new shell with `sudo` directly, without using `su`?
I know a few peers who work remotely as analysts. I would look around LinkedIn for postings. That is where they found theirs. 
The reason aren't relevant since there's no other way around it. I just need to work with it. There's really, really, really no other way to do it. I need, need, need to do it this way. Wondering if Python can achieve it
I can almost guarantee you that there is, in fact, a way around it, but you need to explain why you're trying to do it this specific way. At the very least, you should be able to do `sudo -u other_user -i` to replace your messy `su` command. 
Didn't work. I appreciate the help, but let's stop focusing on why I need to do the command. I need to do it this way. Really. Please.
&gt; ew shell under that user name. "sudo su - newuser" is the first command to type and cannot be done we use pexpect and pxssh on a daily basis in an enterprise environment. pxssh is nice if you have the ability to change the prompt, we do not and have worked up a nice system of regex matching disabling the prompt changing capabilities. If you can put in the effort, the library is rock solid.
Ok. Is there a password prompt when you're running `sudo su - newuser` via SSH manually? 
How much clearer can I be? WE CANNOT CHANGE THE COMMAND.
I'm asking about the exact command you posted originally. Is there a password prompt, or does it immediately take you to a shell?
sure, what you are looking for is tools like [cxFreeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org) etc See the (somewhat) full list [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DistributionUtilities).
Well I just realized that it's linux only!
We cannot change the behaviour. I've told you many times already.
I am not asking you to change the behavior, Jesus Christ. I'm asking you what the behavior is right now. If you run the exact command you must run, is there a password prompt, or does it give you a shell directly? 
maybe buy a couple of vowels?
shell directly. any other command has a password prompt wich fails with cannot run /bin/bash 
You do realize that you just contradicted yourself, do you?
Then you don't need to wait for the command to exit, because it will not. Instead, write the commands you need to run to the subshell's stdin, and then write `exit` to quit the subshell. 
tx u
That's the point of "Zen". It contradicts, but on the other hand, cannot simply be denied. Or to say it with more poetry: "If you go looking for zen, you'll never find it - but if you don't go looking for it, how you suppose to find it." If you never attempted the "Zen" way of thinking, you might not get it. It's simple to explain, yet so hard to translate into words. Okay, I will stop now. :)
The only way is to bundle it as an exe, which has a self contained python basically allowing it to run on a system with no python installed. install pyinstaller pip install pyinstaller Navigate to your pytin script directory Run cmd prompt pyinstaller -F yourscript.py 
Maybe the 'monte carlo' method
But, have you after realized what "this" is? And what actually makes the import of "this"?
I’m not sure I understand the question! 
What does "this" normally refer to?
There are a lot of sequence with pi as a limit
I stand corrected 😂
Here are several different ways to calculate Pi using [Infinite Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Infinite_series)
Thank god for that. 
 resp = requests.get("https://uploadbeta.com/api/pi/?cached&amp;n=100") resp.raise_for_status() pi = int(resp.data)
I saw an absolutely horrendous "implicit over explicit" decision made in the design of python (midnight == false). I cursed the guy who made it and wondered why he didn't follow the zen properly. It turned out the guy who made the decision *wrote* the zen. The decision was later reversed. Yeah, I don't think they take it very seriously themselves....
Btw if you're ever looking to do what I was trying to do, this was the actual answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911690/nested-ssh-session-with-paramiko it doen't use exec_command. It uses invoke_shell 
As /u/bregonator1 mentionned : the Monte Carlo method. Example: Take a picture of apples fallen down from an apple tree, we assume they fell completely randomly on the surface your a photographing. With OpenCV or anything in the like, take a square of side 2R and count the apples in it. Now take a circle that is circumscribed to the square and count the apples in it. Apples in the square a prop to 4R², in the circle prop to pi\*R², take the ratio : et voilà. Pi.
Yeah, Lois from the newest Superman movies
Give his man an apple.
The audio quality is not very good, but I can't speak to the content
Consider: &amp;#x200B; for i in range(10): if i != 5: print(i) &amp;#x200B; vs &amp;#x200B; for i in range(10): if i == 5: continue print(i) &amp;#x200B;
Kind of?, I haven't seen a more accurate translator that's OSS

In python 3.7 there is dataclass. I plan on doing the same thing for the dataclass. But it isn't implemented yet.
1. Unit testing. 2. Legibility/modularity. 3. Code reuse. 4. Flexibility in using interfaces over implementation. 5. It maps more naturally onto most people's mental model of programming problems, as opposed to procedural or functional programming. Of course if you're doing something extremely performance-intensive or trivial, you might not want the overhead.
I don't know if you realise this or not, but that arms race is exactly how deep fakes work. One neural network creates images from noise, and another neural network discriminates whether it is real or not. Working on batches in tandem with each other, the generator network starts producing better and better fakes. They're called GANs, generative adverserial networks.

He mentions some on the article: * Texture analysis, including computing Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) over face regions and using an SVM to classify the faces as real or spoofed. * Frequency analysis, such as examining the Fourier domain of the face. * Variable focusing analysis, such as examining the variation of pixel values between two consecutive frames. * Heuristic-based algorithms, including eye movement, lip movement, and blink detection. These set of algorithms attempt to track eye movement and blinks to ensure the user is not holding up a photo of another person (since a photo will not blink or move its lips). * Optical Flow algorithms, namely examining the differences and properties of optical flow generated from 3D objects and 2D planes. * 3D face shape, similar to what is used on Apple’s iPhone face recognition system, enabling the face recognition system to distinguish between real faces and printouts/photos/images of another person. * Combinations of the above, enabling a face recognition system engineer to pick and choose the liveness detections models appropriate for their particular application.
You do realize that you proved my point again, do you?
I just had a talk with someone on discord about 3d scans of real people to make latex masks the other day, although thankfully if someone wanted it to work first they would need to scale up the rest of their body somehow (including a longer neck) and then they would need a way to fake facial muscle movement....so what give this 5 years till it is a thing? 
eeeehhhhhh, all of these are subjective.
.
Funky monte carlo: - Drop random needles on a grid of parallel lines spaced a needle distance from each other. Measure the number of needles crossing a line compared to the total number of needles. Extract it from a function: - Use sin as a black box method, and try to solve the equation sin(x+y)=sin(x), using interpolation. Mathy: - Write a function which implements the Madhava-Leibniz series.

Looks like it’s on GitHub? Check licensing and if friendly fork it and do your own thing with it. 
I'd argue that opencv is a computer vision library with machine learning features not a machine learning library. It is pretty cool though
Why is this in /r/python?
Uhh... no they're not? Try to unit test any real project written in C.
In several other Object Oriented languages, “this” is the same as “self” in python, though in those languages it generally just exists as a keyword rather than an explicit parameter passed into instance methods like “self” in python.

I have a bunch of apps that people at my office run that are called from a shortcut pointing to Python installed on a network share. I do this using WinPython, but I imagine the same thing is possible with something like Anaconda or maybe even a typical Python install. The shortcut includes the full UNC path to the Python executable and to the script to be run. I just copy the shortcut to people's desktops and they can run the apps without having Python installed locally. They are all Tkinter GUI apps. As for your specific script, I don't have anything to suggest but it should work this way just the same.
Printing failed logins slows shit down, if you really need to see them use logging and write to a file. 
I didn't know that! I always thought it kind of iterated over changes and then compared it against the source and destination. The idea of competing algorithms is pretty cool.
That's cool! I'm looking into doing something similar to you. We depend on Google Sheets heavily at work and I'm looking to automate the creation, sharing and formatting of Google Sheets with python when it detects certain lines in Gmail. However, I'm unable to get Python to create the sheets as the owner account. Holding that off until I can find another way.

What does composition mean here?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance :)
**Composition over inheritance** Composition over inheritance (or composite reuse principle) in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than inheritance from a base or parent class. This is an often-stated principle of OOP, such as in the influential book Design Patterns. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

The CSV module is super easy to work with and makes spreadsheet management really quick. From there it's just a few if statements and for loops and you should be good, I think.

So. Python 3 assumes source code is UTF-8 by default, and Python 2 assumed ASCII by default, but you could always put an encoding magic comment at the top of a file to tell Python your source code is in some other encoding. And you could use any encoding name recognized by Python's `codecs` module. And in Python 2, `rot13` was one of those (in Python 3 it isn't). So in Python 2, you didn't actually need to mess about with manual decoding; you could just write source files directly in rot13, and stick an encoding comment at the top. [Like this](https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-funserver/src/f4405289937a8ffd1dafde737bd070611dfdae0e/funserver/management/commands/funserver.py?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default).

Maybe you should be calculating tau instead? Python's standard library has tau. Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17) [GCC 8.2.0] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; import math &gt;&gt;&gt; math.tau 6.283185307179586 
Calculate the circumference of an n sided polygon as n approaches infinity scaling up by prime numbers only. Seems stupid enough to be called creative, no?
Your function isn't returning anything. def squared(n): squared = n * n return squared s = squared(10) print s Without the return in the example above, nothing is being assigned to s. Your function creates a list, but doesn't return it.

Exactly this. There are always exceptions to the "rules".
Given an x by x space, Draw a circle, with center at (x/2,x/2), with diameter x Randomly place a dot somewhere in this x by x space Add 1 to a counter, and add 1 to circle_counter if it’s in the circle, which can be figured out using the distance formula After the counters are updated, divide the circle_counter by the total counter, and then multiply by 4 Did this using pygame, learned a lot, and had a good old time
Quite caustic, but I appreciate the feedback. Do you think my list is not compelling? Please share your thoughts and offer other good reasons to learn Python.

If you're just aggressively linking outbound to a low-traffic blog you are very likely to get picked up as a spammer. Better to make a self-post and just describe what it is you've written with the link there if needed. Sadly or not it's much better to have a more complete work of tutorials that you've been working on for a while, maybe posted somewhere else (twitter? idk) than "here is 1-3 tutorial(s) about 1 topic that I made should I make more"
 self.free_matrix[self.turn] = self.free_matrix[:] self.X_matrix[self.turn] = self.X_matrix[:] self.O_matrix[self.turn] = self.O_matrix[:] The way you are currently doing it simply assigns object references from the previous turn's state to the current one's.

 just expanding on what Laserdude10642 had offered. proj = ['/folder2/12345_project1', '/folder2/45678_project6', '/folder3/34567_project3'] toMove = ['12345', '34567'] # done in list comprehension. foundFiles = [x for x in proj for y in toMove if y in x] # the above us just a one liner list comprehension which is the # same as doing two for loops and a if statement like this foundFiles = [] for x in proj: for y in toMove: if y in x: foundFiles.append(x) Then all you have to do is move the files in found files. you might want to do it without list comprehension especially if you have more tests you want to add.

I, for one, am incredibly glad that deepfakes are being developed the way they are. The technology is clearly possible. Given that it is possible, it will be abused. Given that it will be abused, I'm very glad that the cutting edge development is happening on github, with regular progress updates, and the press occasionally taking notice of it, rather than in some underground government lab where it will only ever be weaponised. Given that everyone (knowledgeable) is very aware of deepfakes, it's up to the industry to adapt to it. We have the technology to crypto-sign media. That needs to become commonplace; then how good a fake it is won't have any bearing on how believable it is. Of course, this is an extremely optimistic view where media outlets aren't lumbering dinosaurs, and where consumers give a shit about what is demonstrably true.

Oddly enough I made a self-post in LearnPython describing the material, but it vanished. I then made a direct outbound link to youtube (this morning), and it was accepted in Python. I have been browsing LearnPython (mainly in the mornings) and it seems to be better curated than Python. Most of the posts are questions about Python. I think Python reddit should have multiple tabs. One for news, one for projects, one for tutorials, etc. I honestly don't mind the tutorials, but everything mashed together makes it harder for people to find what they are interested in. For Machine learning, there are 3 subreddits I frequent, MachineLearning which is mainly for project and research news, MLQuestions for beginners to any type of question LearnMachineLearning for learners to share resources, ask questions, etc etc. In LearnML you can spam your tutorials. I think it's working decently.
It's rot26 with an implementation bug. 
Absolutely. That is one of the primary reasons why I continued with Rust rather than Go. Rust has no run time similar to C. It was excellent FFI capabilities to write python modules(check pyo3 and I will also post one tutorial for that). It is much more hygienic than cython. 
Is Rust capable of GPU programming? It seems Nvidia uses C,C++ and then uses wrappers around those for other languages? 
I should have started with that, my apologies. I am working a program that is going to parse a command list and output names dates etc... based on what command it reads from the file. Right now I am trying to shlex each line in the command file and then output that to a parsed file like so. header = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[0])) stringDblQuote = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[1])) fileLast = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[2])) stringComma = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[3])) fileFirst = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[4])) stringDblQuoteComma = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[5])) referFirst = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[6])) stringPeriod = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[7])) referLast = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[8])) number = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[9])) stringEmail = (shlex.split(commandListOriginal[10])) The code above will provide the intended output but I am lost at getting all of this to output to a single list item. The function in my original post was my first idea, I was going to just call the function later but ran into the same problem of storing it as a list. My end goal is to parse the file with shlex like I have above and return the output line by line into a new file called commands_new or something similar. 
Doing a heads or tails experiment and trying to create a bin of consecutive iterations. For example, if I create a list of random int from 0 to 1 in range 200, and theres parts in the list where it will be three heads in a row, I want to bin that, or if 4 tails in row bin that, or 8 in a row bin that, and etc. No luck yet.
It's still not as good as C/C++. It has very good opencl and array fire bindings. But CUDA support is not quite there yet. There are some bindings for CUDA and Cudnn. But they are still evolving and not quite production ready. I use arrayfire quite often and it is more than enough for my use cases. 
You probably want to look up the requests and JSON modules. 
I have set wal\_level to be minimal and max\_wal\_senders as zero. Can't see any statistically significant time difference. If you are aware of any other config settings for tweaking copy performance, I can try it out. 
But the onus is on Nvidia for CUDA support right? I really want to learn a lower level language (to broaden my knowledge) and am rooting for Rust as I hear it does a lot of things right. How does arrayfire work? I know nothing of GPU programming, but am really interested. Can arrayfire be used with Nvidia cards as well? If so, it's just not as efficient as CUDA /Cudnn?
&gt; I have been told by the developers it's Python it's not
Yeah it can be ported across Nvidia's CUDA and Opencl. It is extremely easy to work work. Check out the documentation here. https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust It let's you do matrix transformations in GPU/CPU very easily. Similar to pytorch's tensor manipulations. 
These are good questions and the correct answers are always context dependent. If you could provide one specific example (e.g. naming the API services, and maybe your tech stack and the business problem you’re trying to solve), we can drill down and recommend libraries and so on.
Bokeh
Many services offer Python SDKs for their APIs, which are Python libraries for interacting with the API. They are usually well-documented in my experience, but not necessarily Pythonic--they are often translated from another language, perhaps automatically. Alternatively you can make the HTTP requests yourself. For this you'd probably want either requests or aiohttp (if you want to run asynchronously).
Are you kidding, they had this tech back in 1996 according to this one documentary I watched.
You've got to be kidding me. Lack o `rot13` is clearly a regression in the language. That's awesome!
Sounds interesting!
Take a movie of car moving past. Count the rotations N of the wheel and the distance d in pixels traveled in a given time. Get the radius r of the tire. Solve d = N2r pi.

Thank you so much!!!
Oh ok thanks ;)
Thanks. :)
It's inside an imported module's __init__.py file. Not in Op's code.
If I understand correctly, your version would be used like this: api = Api() logic = BusinessLogic(api.fetch_remote_data()) logic.do_stuff() time.sleep(10) logic.do_stuff() While OP's version is used as follows: api = Api() logic = BusinessLogic(api) logic.do_stuff() time.sleep(10) logic.do_stuff() In your version the two calls to `logic.do_stuff()` always work with the same data, while in OP's version the two calls to `logic.do_stuff()` use different data, i.e., freshly fetching from the API each time. How can your approach replace OP's approach? To me it seems like they solve two different things.
Check that : http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Streaming_Data.html
This is difficult in practice due to temporal aliasing. Unless the car is really slow, or you have a high frame rate camera.

I'm quite familiar with Zen's approach of embracing contradiction to "break" dualist thinking. I just don't think this is a particularly insightful or enlightening example - AFAICT it's just a cute little joke that superficially copies a Zen-like form to make it look deep. Not every contradiction is an opportunity towards enlightening; some are just contradictions.

Python 101 is one of the many books which i love reading. Apart from Python 101 i like reading Learning Python, Python cookbook, Python Programming, Python in a Nutsehell . All the books which i mentioned above are based on the Course of Python which i am pursuing so it helps me alot in polishing my skills and knowledge . I recommend you to pursue [Courses for python](http://www.cetpainfotech.com/technology/python-training) and read these books as a reference which would help you to understand every detail about Python.
I'm trying to program the backlight of my keyboard to turn on, get brighter, dimmer, and then off based on keystrokes. My initial plan was to make a keylogger, print number of elements present in the logger, i.e number of keystrokes, if mod 3 = 0 is true (because from off to full brightness its 3 presses, and vise versa), call the other function. What i mean by that is assuming that each keystroke has caused the backlight to get brighter, after 3 strokes, it will be peak brightness, so it will call another function which starts to make the backlight dimmer, till its off (i.e 3 strokes). I planned to do this because I wanted to see what it would look like, probably pretty cool, but also because I wanted to expand my skillset into a little more hardware. However, mapping the keys required to be pressed to increase or decrease the backlight brightness is not something I'm able to find online, because it involves the "Function" key, which doesn't seem to allow remapping. I'm using an MSI GL63 8RD for this. Any suggestions?

In my reading this refers to data structures. Not `for` loops, since you sometimes can't really help with that.
[removed]
Yes, but they didn't call it "this" for nothing. 
It was enough to get me through! Thanks! :)
Fair enough.
Celery is the right way to go. With your webapp, you enqueue a task in redis/rabbitmq, and in another machine/container your celery worker will watch the redis/rabbitmq and execute any tasks that it gets from the queue. If your independent python projects can not be installed in the same venv, then what you can do is run several celery workers, one for each of those projects.
In that case, you should call `BusinessLogic.do_stuff` on the two pieces of data. Business logic should as much as possible be functional and work with only data. It should be agnostic of any I/O like outside APIs and database calls. Why couple them together? Ah, but you might think "dependency injection to the rescue". Don't pass in `api`, but rather `Api` and let `BusinessLogic` do that. The biggest problem with dependency injection is that if the business logic has nested function calls, and the inner most function needs data from the dependency, then you have to inject the dependency all the way down. This is why huge dependency injection frameworks exist (e.g. Spring). Rather than do that, have the caller responsible for getting the data and passing it on to your logic. Logic and I/O ought to be glued together procedurally at the top level of your program. This way, code can be easily moved around or refactored.
Thanks for the explanation. I like stateless functional logic, so I'm totally with you on that. &amp;#x200B; Regarding the dependencies, I guess both styles make sense, depending on context or even taste, i.e.: \- Glue the logic together at the top level \- Let a DI framework figure out how to wire stuff, at least in statically types languages
A cube is a 3-vector rotated by two of the three 90 degrees that are available to it. Literally as pictured on Wikipedia if you search and find 3D rotation. You then just loop over these points and draw the lines that have the same length as your vector original, adding the origo. This is a flat code structure.

This is pretty interesting. I'll be following along and, if open to it, contributing, as I see myself using it. My history file is massive as I like to search back for commands I've long since forgotten! One thing that stands out to me, because I've been having a personal dilemma with it, is the placement of the tool's config folder (`source_data`). `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/store_data`, `$HOME/.config/store_data` or some custom location would be far preferable to placing the folder directly in the home folder. Also putting more restrictive permissions on the credentials file (0600). 
Don’t ever use global variables. But why are they there? Because they are useful in certain circumstances and you’re not ready.
It’s a joke. Import this file?
Sounds to me like something that might be better suited for a pipeline framework like Apache Airflow, or the Luigi framework. That very much depends on why you want expose these ETL jobs through a Web API though. Have you considered any of those solutions?
How about Jenkins? There is a rest api and jobs can run shell/powershell scripts.
&gt; you could always put an encoding magic comment at the top of a file to tell Python your source code is in some other encoding Um, not *always*. Certainly not back in Python 1 days, which is when the `this` module was created.

&gt; In several other Object Oriented languages, “this” is the same as “self” in python, though in those languages it generally just exists as a keyword rather than an explicit parameter passed into instance methods like “self” in python.
Some sauce on the documentary? And to be clear yes it is within the realms of the tech of today to produce something that can sense every muscle movement of a face under a mask, and it is doable to replicate said movements on some form of mask, but with that being said, this is still a very young tech, 3d scan to 3d print is a thing that truthfully we have been able to do since the whole art thing become a thing, all of that is based on the rules of perspective and some basic math. But the tech to take sample photo of someone's face from less than ideal conditions and cobble them together into a working facsimile of their face complete with the individual idiosyncrasies that each person has to their facial muscle movement....we don't have that yet, we can approximate it to some extent and the people with those skills tend to work in places like Pixar, if you have the skills to make a facial rig and animate it, you are quite likely well on your way to a 100k a year job... but the face has 40 some muscles controlled by what 7 nerves. That is quite a bit of data to capture, sift through and reproduce. And right now we are just now starting to get to the point where we can capture enough of that data in real time to do something with it, but I'm saying this as someone who has been doing motion capture for several years, the technology to do the type of facial capture needed for that from subpar footage is still a few years out (although a good animator can make it work today) Now to produce a latex mask that does this...yeah it is kinda feasible today, but quite frankly I don't see it happening the face is a complicated thing and unfortunately we don't have latex eyelids as of yet., if I 'had' to put something together to do this I would need a workstation with 12 cores 4Ghz on a xenon or threadripper at least and 4 Nvidia Quadro cards, and most likely about 10-50 hours of video on the subject to produce a viable 3d model of them and rig it as needed (talking about 300 hours of work there). And even then I would need an actor who can capture their mannerisms well enough to make the clone head dance well enough while being rendered in real time to MAYBE fool the device, and this is assuming that I can mimic the color space, fov, aperture, refresh rates and even compression algorithms of the camera that is doing the capturing. Not to mention that no lense is every perfectly clean and I suspect we may need to fake some lense imperfections as well, whatever encoded the bio sig may be aware that each lense has a foot print and may have those indexed according to serial number. &amp;#x200B; If anyone is interested in some hands on training in photo forgery detection, I would suggest grabbing any 3d software (blender is actually ideal for this one) and work on extracting viable normal maps from photo sources, do that for about 4 weekends and you will be well on your way to getting a grounding in the common footprints that is left behind by photoshopping.
It's probably going to be hard to jump right into one of these. Think about it from the hiring manager's POV. They are going to hire someone they don't know to work sight unseen. Kind of iffy. You are more likely to succeed if you look for non-remote jobs and ask about flextime/work-from-home stuff during the interview. Then after a year or two, try to transition to remote.

EOL of Python 2.x is grave mistake.
I think it was meant as "Python: import yourself", and than Python produces a self-reference, or a self-reflection. Which completes the circle.

Put it in writing/CYA. I'm not a network admin, but the politics are the same. Make a very clear document of industry standards that are not being followed, how that's affecting the area you were brought in to address, and the potential consequences of not fixing it. Send it to all pertinent parties, maybe schedule a meeting so they can ask questions and so you know they've heard it in person. It's up to you how hard you push or if you stay, but you can prevent a black mark on your own record if you have a paper trail.
You’re calling ‘dumps’ on a string — that won’t work.
I had to do something similar. I wrote a memo called, "what I've learned in the first 90 days". A key thing to keep in mind is that where possible you should address your understanding of why they do something. Demonstrate that you understand why they are doing something, not just that you're aware of a better way. Try to have proposed solutions that both address the risks you've seen and the underlying/historic reasons for it being a certain way.

Check out The Hitch Hikers Guide to Python, it's on GitHub. Try using turtle to do some basic graphics. Look into Project Euler, there are some very good tools like Euler Py (or Py Euler? I forget) that let you never leave the command like while you do problems. pysdl and pygame are also great if you plan on making some games. Good luck :)
Sometimes it's not your fault. VFX (movie graphcs) use a lot of python because it's the embedded scripting language for tools like Maya. If Maya doesn't upgrade, they can't. Many people also don't appreciate how much code the VFX studios have.
Thanks! I've been wanting to get back into Python for a while. I did some in college but that was a couple years ago so I've forgotten it all. Any other good resources you'd recommend?
I get the point ( although I disagree with the way you phrased it) but I would not have seen this video without it being posted here.
You were actually kinda right, I've been doing the 3d art thing for about 10 years now, but yeah as of the moment it still takes a silly amount of human computational power to do this on a vfx level, still with the way things are looking I give it about 5 years till we start seeing applications that stand a chance to fool these type of biometrics on the open market as a package made for idiots to use.
I like this solution. It’s an approach that makes you seem more friendly in solving the problem at hand. It also doubles as CYA documentation. 
I second Jenkins. We run ~45 odd python jobs on it. Single jobs, cascading jobs, docker containers, manual, sceduled, triggered, from api, authenticated etc. The most flexible scheduler and data-gatherer I've used.
Sure thing! 
that doesn't seem like a very good attempt at an academic poll 
how about simply posting the link to the PyData channel's video? Literally the same video.
He doesn’t mean not posting it to Reddit, he means that OP is reuploading another person’s videos to their own YouTube channel and then posting THAT video to reddit. The former is great for sharing interesting videos while helping the creator grow and produce more quality content, while the latter is absolutely theft.
Sure. 
ah - sorry, didn't catch that part :) mea culpa

I kinda doubt you really have learned Python well. If you had JavaScript would be a thing of the past with you (outside the browser). Beyond that being a skilled developer in any language takes months to years of coding. 
I'm doing the same thing now. You have a lot of starting points here: [https://github.com/guardrailsio/awesome-python-security](https://github.com/guardrailsio/awesome-python-security) Have fun!
Will Python 4 be released soon after Python 2 dies, so the community will have a new topics to debate on?
That's right. GitLab is 100% remote. Currently we have 2 data analyst. Here's the open positions page [https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/apply/](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/apply/)
Some won't but it won't be updated for security which is a big problem for enterprise unless they are running an air gapped network. 
Python 3.X is superior to 2.X in just about every way. The fact of the matter is Python is only growing in popularity, so abandoning the old way of doing things from 2.x to move to the better way in 3.x was necessary, despite the pain it caused from legacy things transitioning. Python 3 has been out 10 years now. go back to hand-coding AT&amp;T assembly if you have such an issue moving on. 
I suspect Python4 will be backwards compatible to Python3, and be more of a marketing release vs an incompatible release.
&gt; We have the technology to crypto-sign media. That needs to become commonplace; then how good a fake it is won't have any bearing on how believable it is. &gt; &gt; Of course, this is an extremely optimistic view where media outlets aren't lumbering dinosaurs, and where consumers give a shit about what is demonstrably true. Haha I have a very much less optimistic view of the general population's interest in actual truth

People have been starting new work in Python 2.7 for a lot longer than that. 5yrs or so ago there were still major libraries that did not have py3 support. If you needed those libraries for business reasons, you were shit out of luck on python 3. I love python3 and am so glad I'm able to write py3 code every day after doing python 2.7 for 5+ years. So many stupid problems disappeared, and you're actually able to take advantage of 9+ years of improvements since development stopped on py2.7. I think I would cry if I had to go back to writing python 2.7 full time
The end quote on "owner" also looks strange. You shouldn't need to do dumps at all
If your list is compelling and easy to understand (honestly, it is -- but your post gave the impression that it wouldn't be to newcomers), then this post is redundant. If not, then you should at least reconsider the angle you're taking when introducing people to Python.
you put an /s, but honestly it's true
They are not planning to make a Python 4 release. Changing the major version number would imply a heavy rewrite of something and is not planned
In Guido's words, Python 4 will just be "the release following the last 3.x version".

Versioning at it's worst. Just like linux.
That title and description felt like it was listing an NPM dependency tree.
Python 3 is older. The thing is that Python 3 wasn't really viable as a successor until 3.6 (released: 23 Dec 2016) and probably should only be replaced by 3.7 (released: 17 Jun 2018). Why? Because 3.7 actually has features that might be useful that simply are not available in the same way in 2.7. However, for most part, there are no features that are needed for 2.7 and nothing so special that 2.7 should be abandoned. My guess is that you probably weren't around for it, but the Python 3 rework - the reasoning given to the python community for why it would be backwards incompatible - was that there were gains to be seen in performance. Python 2.7 was faster for nearly all of the code I wrote in comparison to 3.5 and lower. Python 3.6 and Python 3.7 when profiled were close enough to be noise. But none of Python 3 is a *better* performer. So it's a bit like having an older car that you drive around with no car payments and then a dealership trying to sell you a slower car with significant car payments. And you are left scratching your head wondering why they're even selling the new car. That said, all of my code base at this point has been migrated to 3.7 and new efforts are being written in 3.7 unless there's an underlying factor that prevents that full upgrade.
Yes, embedded interpreters and legacy monoliths will live for a long time, but who cares? I'm sure there are people still running Excel versions with VB6-style code, but nobody writes new libraries or tools for them. I mean, there are plenty of old Websphere and Weblogic instances managed with piles of hacky Jython 2.2 scripts. Have you seen anything new come up for Jython 2.2 in the last 5 to 10 years? 
You can calculate the length of the graph of sqrt(1-x\^2) from -1 to 1.
Can you explain how a better transition would have worked, considering that there's no way to force developers to transition their libraries?
cat ~/.bash_history ?
Hindsight is always 20/20, but what I'd have like would have been something like this: 2.8 - all \`\_\_future\_\_\` tags are now default behavior 2.9 - urllib2 / etc library naming conventions updated 2.10 - str / unicode rework 3.0 - if you made it from 2.7 to 2.10, migrating to 3.0 should be easy!
I take issue with the community “generally” (not everyone) relishing the fact the 2.7 is on its way out. The language wouldn’t be where it is today without sitting on the backs of giants like 2.7– do you folks get that? You can love both, they are diametrically opposed to each other— just an FYI The obsessive compulsive behavior of some ppl here jumping into the 2 vs 3 wars has been so played out that it’s super boring now— the bickering is inane. I get the impression that some ppl would rather argue than help contribute to the community and language as a whole— this stain needs to be washed out soon. 
IMO the issues with putting existed, because they gave too much time. Ruby broke compatibility even in minor versions and no one bat an eye, because if you stayed on older version your code would not be supported within a year. Python gave 12 years to port programs, no one did anything until fire was lighted on their tail. Python 3rd party packages started adding Python 3 support in 2015 (the original deadline that turned into Python 2.7 entering a maintenance (no new features backported from Python 3, yes Python 2.7 was essentially Python 2.6 with backported features from Python 3, I heard many people here saying why should they port to 3 when there is no interesting features in 3, that was the reason. Once 2.7 entered maintenance mode we started seeing new features that weren't in Python 2.7). Most organization's started converting to Python 3 this year, after Python 2.7 started displaying warning on every start that it will be EOL in 2020. The lesson here IMO is, that there was no real benefit giving all that time to port, everyone will start when a deadline is approaching.
&gt; You can't rewrite a bunch of shit, release it, then complain that no one is using it. A few problems were somehow underestimated. Things like the prefix `u` for unicode strings, which was basically reintroduced as a no-op in 3.2 (iirc) - dropping it looked like a logical and minor change, now that all strings were unicode, but adding it back as a stub helped a lot of people with their ports. Probably a few other things could have done with a bit more stubbing / deprecation warnings - but all of this adds to unfashionable and annoying code, which the core team was trying to avoid or remove in their big "blank slate" v3 push. Also, I think "the media" over-estimated the 3.0 release, which was really experimental. That resulted in a backlash that kept going way beyond the time it was actually based in reality. 3.2 was already in a "portable" state for most of the ecosystem, but still people were dragging their feet because of the 3.0 experience. It's not an uncommon problem for open-souce projects of this magnitude. When you have a big rewrite, there is only so much info you can gather from a beta program, at some point you have to push for wider usage so you can find where the real problems lie; but every new release is scrutinized like it was 100% ready for production, and can cause serious damage to the "product brand". KDE had similar issues with their 4.x rewrite, for example.

Thanks all for you answers. i'll provide you more details. For now, for each job i execute, i will create a python thread/subprocess which execute shell to command to create folder +git clone + venv + requirements and which copy the config files inside and execute the main. Then it will report by email if it fail or succees and keep logs. I did also create a system which allow to execute a job after an other one finished. So all i had to do was to list my jobs in a json file ( git url, id, name, email\_personns ) and then they were executed every night. But this was for prototype ( even if \~1 year of production ). &amp;#x200B; Now i need my jobs to be called by an api. So i should expose them as an api :) Also some "stuffs" should be provide to execute the job as file or args or json datas. &amp;#x200B; Following your answer i'm very intested by Jenkins. Do you think he will answer all my need ? &amp;#x200B; I also heard about Luigi before but it seems harder to execute jobs with shell and seems more focus on big pipelines which is not my case. ( only 2-3 jobs in a row ). &amp;#x200B; Regards, &amp;#x200B;
\&gt; When you have a big rewrite, there is only so much info you can gather from a beta program, at some point you have to push for wider usage so you can find where the real problems lie &amp;#x200B; So true. You really don't know what the major pain points of a conversion will be until you get something out there. I just wish they would have done a few more major releases on 2.x that helped folks that want to get closer to 3.x at least make SOME progress instead of continuing to knowingly write code that is not future-compatible.
&gt; ETL jobs Hey thanks .What is an ETL jobs ? &amp;#x200B;
Hmm, that's a bit too forward for code if you want others to use it! I have been writing until last year to 3.4, as that's distributed on Ubuntu Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS (Trusty Tahr) and the corresponding Red Hat distribution, both of which are in wide but decreasing use. Trusty is end-of-life in a few weeks and all my new code will target 3.5. I was actually writing 3.5 in new code last year in anticipation. I think it's particularly risky to target 3.7, because there are no unmissable features in it, and it has come out so recently that many, perhaps most production installations have yet to upgrade to it. It means you are forcing consumers of your code to have one exact specific version of Python - 3.7. I have had a long time practice of (all else being equal) supporting "three versions" of any external dependencies: the new version, the current version and the old version. As of today, new=3.7, current=3.6 and old=3.5. Now, my guess is that if I went to a random terminal and typed `python3 --version` I'd see about 20% Python 3.7, 30% for 3.6, 20% for 3.5, 15% for 3.4 and 5% for "other"(3.3, 3.8alpha, etc) --- I didn't actually know what would happen on this machine if I did this in a fresh environment because I work entirely in virtualenvs. And in fact: $ deactivate &amp;&amp; python3 --version &amp;&amp; uname -a Python 3.4.4 Darwin bantam.local 16.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Fri Apr 27 17:59:46 PDT 2018; root:xnu-3789.73.13~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 So 3.4 is still around and on the machine in front of me, much to my surprise...
What's the alternative? As it's been proven (both by Python and Linux), people *don't like* anything else. No developer wants to think about what the version means - they just want to grab the latest production release and go.

You guys are the greatest I was getting frustrated 
What? 3.4 was viable as a replacement. 3.5 was an upgrade. 3.7 is faster in most benchmarks.
Hey guys, this is my first ever package on pip. It’s purpose is to enable modular regex pattern management and enhance match objects, with groups and most importantly subgroups. Let me know what you think of it and of course feel free to fork on github. Any critiques and suggestions are welcome!
When only last release matters versioning scheme used by Firefox/Chrome/SystemD/Ubuntu is good. I would probably vote for Ubuntu's scheme as it gives a good idea on how old this particular release is. Using semver format and arbitrarily changing major version number is very confusing.
Do you think visual effects (movie graphics) have no need to start new projects? If you're forced to use embeded interpreters and you start a new project, you're forced to use the old language. Even after the new interpreter appears, you're still forced to use the old language until your code is converted. I can tell you for thee that ILM (star wars movie graphics) have over 3 million lines of code. I don't know much of that is Python, but VFX has a lot of code.
Not being able to use the u' prefix in early Python 3's was a definite blocker for large swaths of my code. Couldn't even consider moving to 3 until the 2.x unicode handling for static strings became compatible. 
There’s multiple that work. I think to reduce confusion, Python should just forever stay 3.X, since there will never be a disruptive-enough change to warrant 4.0
Youtube vids? I'd be interested in that, but nowhere near Sofia
The error message indicates bad json. And your json looks bad. Try fixing your json. 
I have been using Python since 1996 and I really do not remember Python 3 being sold as a performance enhancement. It was just cleaning up loose ends that had accumulated since the invention of the language. Very few of the changes had any performance relevance at all. In fact it would be fairly obvious that pervasive Unicode is more likely to slow things down than speed them up. http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/questions_and_answers.html 
A tool to archive lots of folders and files. But I know next to nothing about python. So I'll be working on this for many weeks to come Wish me luck. 
RH will maintain support for 2.7 until 2024.
Python 3.7 and 3.7 add “diametrically opposed?” I don’t even know what that means. Supporting two different languages in libraries and tutorials is a real ongoing burden. It costs the Python community thousands of hours per year. It is quite understandable that people are excited about the end of that wasteful period.
The natural break would be whenever the GIL is removed.
Huh? No developer I know wants that. We want to be able to upgrade a package knowing that the upgraded package should be backwards compatible with your code. The spread of semantic versioning has at least made my life as a maintainer of many projects a lot easier.
Before anybody can help you you must at least try yourself. So we know that you aren't just using us
Well, to be fair, there are two things that Python 2 is still better at. (I hasten to add that I would never even contemplate doing new development in it, and I don't miss it at all!) The first is speed. Early versions of Python 3 were much slower than Python 2.7. The gap has narrowed a great deal but I still think that benchmarks put Python 3.7 as little slower than 2.7. If I want speed I use numpy, or I switch to C++. Tiny speed differences between Python versions are not an issue, but they are there. ---- The second is "crappy text processing". I don't have a great name for this, but what fairly often happens is that I have some Python tool that I have to run over a large number of source files and other text files that have been stepped on by a large number of developers. Well, what unfortunately happens in the real world is that some of these files end up with inconsistent encodings. I had worked on one code base where there were multiple files with inconsistent encodings _within the same file!_ (Someone had pasted in a copyright notice at the top of these files with a UTF-8 character in it, but the rest of the text was Latin and our editors were mostly smart enough to render everything right and other people noticed it but never thought to ask...) Now, this is definitely a quality defect in the original files, but when I wrote this code in Python 2 it chewed right through the files and did what I told it to do the first time. When I ported it to Python 3, I got obscure encoding errors, reading through the files didn't show the problem, and I wasted more than an hour figuring it out, as I kept thinking that it was different files that had different encodings, and not different encodings in a single file... The funny part is that I went from that to another project where much the same problem cropped up caused in a similar way! Except of course this time I knew it right off. My belief is that there's got to be a lot of files like that, particularly in older organizations with a lot of cruft and history. Python 2 doesn't know encodings from a hole in the wall, and it just reads the bytes in, applies C-style string processing to them, and you're done. In Python 3, there is no great way to guess an encoding, and even more, there's no way at all to deal with a file with multiple encodings other than "by hand". Would I write such a thing in Python 2 today? Hell, no. I haven't written Python 2 in many years and aside from one library I maintain, I never will again.
How about just keep it 3.x?
IF? I don't think it is a WHEN. As a polyglot, I don't personally see the point of it. If I wan't performance I am not using Python, GIL or not. If I want pretty code - I don't care about the GIL. I just multi-process the crap out of my code.
Messed up on my comment earlier (sorry about that)— I meant aren’t not are. “Wasteful period” ? The language was/is straddling 2 versions of itself and frankly the “sizzle” of 3 wasn’t there yet that justified the big switch IMHO. The migration of 2 into 3 projects/modules could have been (or should have been) a major focus in the release to get ppl to cross the threshold in a better manner. Attractive/popular 2.7 projects (garnishing the majority of users) should have had the time and reason to ready themselves for the transition into 3 (I’m talking about early releases of 3) but I got the sense that the need to jump into 3 in such an abrupt manner caused the fractions and animosity. 
&gt;In Python 3, there is no great way to guess an encoding, and even more, there's no way at all to deal with a file with multiple encodings other than "by hand". From Python's own [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html): &gt;#Files in an Unknown Encoding &gt;What can you do if you need to make a change to a file, but don’t know the file’s encoding? If you know the encoding is ASCII-compatible and only want to examine or modify the ASCII parts, you can open the file with the `surrogateescape` error handler Would not this be the solution you'd need for this problem? 
Yeah it will be end of an era. These dual versions of python has been a source of embarrassment for the experienced members of the community and endless source of confusion for newcomers. But let's not forget **how good python 2.7** **was**. Until python 3.6 came out only a small fraction of the developers had strong enough reason to make the transition (most of the "cool" features were successfully backported to 2.7 anyway). 3.6 and the new dictionary along with many other changes like format strings finally gives the developers enough reason to make the transition. RIP 2.7, we'll never forget you.
Grep is what I use now but doesn't carry over to different systems. This actually looks useful.
Ah, now I get what you mean. And I love 2.10. The str/unicode part is the trappiest for legacy code. Thing is - your 2.8 isn't a 2.x release. It isn't backwards compatible - 2.7 code that worked before will now break - and a lot of it, think of all those print statements!! So that was never a possible path. A 2.8 that cannot execute all 2.7 code is no 2.8 at all. Also, wait, isn't 2.10 also covered by a `__future__` and would so be part of 2.8? --- Which reminds me of a joke. Hey, did you hear they're switching to driving on the right in the UK? S'fact. They're doing it in stages - the first week cars, the next week buses and the third week lorries.

I’ll buy that. Either way it’s funny in a nerdy Monty Python sort of way.
Hey Pythonistas. I am transitioning into a new job where I will be using Python professionally on a daily basis. I've used Python in a handful of projects before, but typically for PoCs. I had a grudging relationship with Python before, but I'm really loving it now. Here's one of a few projects I've chugged out lately. It's a Tor router CLI; it uses a simple API to route all network traffic through Tor (and to check on the connection status). I used `pycodestyle` to help me with PEP8. Any additional feedback is greatly appreciated. Live long, hackers.
ETL means extract-transform-load, referring to moving data between two data sources. For example, if you're importing data from a business partner, converting it into a data format that's convenient to you and storing the converted data in your own database, that would be an ETL job.
Wait there are only 9 months left to 2020?
Use continue. Just starts next iteration of the loop. 
I just started with python. Making my first tic tac toe game using no 'hard coding'. 
Not entirely sure what you are implying here. Either (a) you expect no updates to ever be written and therefore python will stay the same forever, or (b) the version numbers will stay under 4. Either way what would be the point? Python 3 wasn't backward compatible with 2, and it caused problems back then but sometimes you have to break systems to modernize it (I'm looking at you Xorg!)
&gt;since there will never be a disruptive-enough change to warrant 4.0 Just out of curiosity, why do you think this?
Abrupt? You know Python 3.0 was released in 2008, right? 
No of course I'm not implying that they won't update python ever again. I'm just saying that it's not in the works to break backwards compatibility
Thanks for this suggestion. 
I didn't know this existed. I just tried and it is good. Thank you
&gt; we want predictable behaviour. 3.0 was *extremely* predictable: all the breaking changes were widely advertised, it was a major release and all. Semantic versioning was respected fully. And still people hated being told they had to port. &gt; We want to be able to upgrade a package knowing that the upgraded package should be backwards compatible with your code That's the real complaint: that py3 changed *too much* in one go. *That* is what you want: a stream of minor upgrades, maintaining backward compatibility for a long time (possibly forever). And that's what you will get now. Respecting semver, in that sense, is fundamentally irrelevant: people want to get the latest release and make it run their old code anyway.
You can also just type the command 'hist' and it'll show you your bash history. It's common for people to grep their bash history for previously used commands.

&gt; Hmm, that's a bit too forward for code if you want others to use it! Depends on your environment. We have full control over ours and we are our own consumers. But with something like containers, this is far less of an argument than it once was.

Working on a slackbot at work using their api. It's pretty incredible the questions it can answer in real time. 
I don't want a stream of minor breaking changes in a language.. If it has to be done and it can't be backwards compatible it should be done all in one go. It's much easier to plan upgrades for various customers Django projects that way. No customer would want to hear that we need to schedule 4 upgrades over the following years instead of one, it's just more time and money spent doing the same thing over and over again instead of doing it once.
Your first two functions don't return anything. Maybe instead of print(add) you could return add. Then print(addNum()) should print 6. Same for subNum maybe the last furction could be def multNum(a,b): mult = a * b return mult Then you could print(multNum(addNum(),subNum())) if you those functions do something. Also you can print(multNum(7,5)) And see a complicated way to compute 35.

They will never be as good as a purpose-built IDE like PyCharm in my opinion, at least not without a lot of plugins and heavy customization. Maybe this is a controversial stance, but I think a lot of people who favor command-line editors for coding do so not because it makes them more efficient or helps them write better code, but because of the "coolness factor". Don't get me wrong, vim is a great text editor with an incredible array of customization options available, and you should learn it. Vim is like a Swiss army knife: undoubtedly useful, but if you're in the kitchen and you need to open a can, you wouldn't use it over the automatic can opener that excels at that specific purpose.

Semantic versioning dictates that 3.10 would be the next
I appreciate your reply and everything /u/mbussonn, but months later I am still very upset that this heuristic simplification is the default.
I would be curious to read others opinion. I just went down the vim rabbit hole since I started learning Python. Coming from a full IDE(Xcode &amp; Swift) I’m not sure if Vim is the best thing. 
A client for working with APIs made with linked-data (JSON-LD)
Because that's what Guido said. It's taken a decade to shift the mindset of the community towards upgrading to python 3, and even now there are plenty of holdouts. The language is pretty solid now, without glaring flaws like py2 had (it can have additions, which is fine). The amount of developer effort and edge-case bugs which arise from cross-compatible code is probably just not worth the relatively small gains which could be achieved from further breaking changes.
What have you tried? Your question seems like more suited to r/learnpython
A better python package index: https://pydist.com Also working on my work-work, which is less fun but hey at least it's still python.
Well, whatever the future, let's hope *more* breaking changes aren't in its future.
Cool
One of the ugliest and less ellegant shit i've seen is angular 1-&gt; 2. It was "solved" with the whole angularjs != angular but damn. Incompatible versions should not be "versions" but treated like another project. Anything with the same name should be compatible. Also,we should start evergreening everything as we can (this would be easier if the first point holds true).
Impossible
As the crow flies? By roads? By shortest road route? Are we talking GPS coordinates or street addresses? In general I would say to check out the google maps api if you are talking street addresses. This will not be as the crow flies distance however. If you need that, use the API to transcode street address to GPS coordinates and then simply google how to work with those to calculate distances. All of this and more is available on a google near you, these are all pretty much solved problems.
Even if GIL is replaced, why should it change code semantics?
Industrial Light and Magic are still running Python 1.4, and that's almost as old as I am. Long live Python 2.7!
An application that makes it easier for golf tournament directors to keep track of data. Will speed up a lot of work and calculations, and hopefully be scalable to a tournament of n size and n rounds :)
It would be a major change. It may or may not change code semantics. It's pretty common that only certain variable types would be threadsafe and it may require an implicit locking system such that only code written a certain way could take advantage of a GIL-free interpreter.
I understand, but my point is about *tooling* and *ecosystem*: you cannot do anything about embedded interpreters, it’s their own problem (and their customers’), they simply will not be catered to by the ecosystem at large. If I make a great free library and then someone comes up saying “it doesn’t work in this or that embedded interpreter that ships version X.Obsolete”, I will probably say “sorry, can’t do”. Otherwise we would be still supporting Python 2.1/2.2, the first versions to find large success. To be clear, I don’t blame ILM or others in their situation; it’s the products they use that are laggards and should be taken to task. 
I thought I saw him say somewhere (PEP discussions in version naming??) a python 4 would have to have some major changes such as removing the GIL. Until then it will just be python 3.x with the intent to maintain backwards compatibility.
Curious that I've been downvoted multiple times without anyone offering a differing opinion. If you have a counter-argument, let's hear it. ;)
The two statements (“4.0 will come after the last 3.x” and “4.0 will come with a big change”) are not exclusive.
Use [geopy](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/)
Would be a lot clean if using a futures run in a threadpoolexecutor. You would be able to crash if one of the processing dies. Moreover as it's clearly not CPU bound, but I/O you should increase concurrency A LOT.
What examples have you found? What searches have you done? If they were inconclusive, post the search terms you used, and I'd be happy to help you formulate the searches which bring you answers. 
You never have "breaking backwards compat" in the works. Is usually a side effect of some really good enough but big change. They can totally find some case in 5 years from now. The debate is between making the language evolve and assume breaking changes, or making the language 100% backwards compatible even if it means that it can (and will) get stale.
You are conflating two things that are not equivalent. You can appreciate 2.7 while still celebrating advancement to 3.7. 
Not a down-voter, but pycharm uses a ton of plugins as well. Also, the point of vim and emacs is to customize them to be what you want them to be for you. No one uses them for any length of time with stock configuration. But, I agree with your fundamental point. I use Pycharm, even though I have a well developed .vimrc.
If I told you that I was going into the energy industry, would you be able to tell me how to prepare? The Finance industry is huge, with many roles you could take on. Python maybe crucial to your success. It may also br entirely irrelevant. I can't tell you which because you haven't told us much of anything about what you're trying to do.
Fair point, thank you.
They are more lightweight and more customizeable/scriptable. A lot of that is batteries not included though. Overall, they have the potential to be superior but not without a lot of work from the end user. And some of that work will not be improving over pycharm, but just matching it. Overall - pycharm is a superior tool for python development.
I never used python 2. What were somethings people prefer besides python 3?
&gt;Because that's what Guido said That's not the way it is though.. It's a simplified explanation of what things actually will be. It will not be a major change, but there will be breaking changes. There are future imports that will become the default in Python 4. No, there are no plans to introduce something like unicode, but then again, had you done it right in the first place, it's not a breaking change. Nothing else in the 2 to 3 transition is even worth discussing.

To set the record straight, I love any and all versions of python— I use a couple version based on what I need it for. I agree with your statement about my appreciation/celebration of the language. I am though sick and tired of the “let’s crap on 2” mentality that the community loves to do (not everyone— I know). All I’m trying to say is this whole inner fighting really happened when the very popular and attractive parts/projects that sat on the 2.7 side of the fence weren’t easily migrated or transferred over into the world of 3 so you had a bunch of ppl having to account for both in the early days... I’m well aware how long 3 has been out, the shift from 2 into 3 would have been served better if 3 had more sizzle or solid reasons to make the jump as well as if the important projects from 2 (heavily relied upon) could have made the jump easier as well. I’m not surprised with the downvoting going on here— it more or less confirms my presumption/statement about the Reddit python community and the 2 vs 3 nonsense. 
because there's awesome and easy to use python wrappers around C and C++ libraries. Same reason as always. 
Recently I started working with actuaries building financial models for options valuation (Monte Carlo simulations at the core but a lot of other stuff around them too). The main system is built, and were working to develop a meta-layer of data processing on top of it that updates a SQL database with daily data, and then builds analytics on top of it - e.g. market movement, volatility, hedge effectiveness, etc. I work (almost) exclusovely in Python these days, but the actuaries' main languages/platforms seem to be Python, Matlab, R and Excel. 
Don't really have a use for this but it looks pretty cool!
So if I I understand you correctly: there will never be a 4.0 because the language has matured enough that any added features that will break compatibility is not worth the effort for the community at large. But doesn't this assume that an increase in integer goes hand in hand with breaking backward compatibility? There was some discussion above about version numbering. Personally I don't really mind how Linux handles their versioning; features are added and they are given a label. The old way of dropping a real version, comparable to windows 98, 99 etc, has a different feeling but essentially boils down to the same thing. 
Which one did you refer to when you said “they”?
And I guess i should say, not only do I use pycharm, but I pay for it.
&gt; The language wouldn’t be where it is today without sitting on the backs of &gt;giants like 2.7 The language wouldn't be where it is today if we'd listen to the Python 2.7 diehards, many of whom openly advocated for throwing out Python 3 entirely and creating a Python 2.8 to replace it. http://blog.thezerobit.com/2014/05/25/python-3-is-killing-python.html
Thanks! It is intended for projects that rely heavily on regex and make use of hundreds - if not thousands - of them, such as some I’m working on now. For just simple/few regex it is totally overkill.
That makes Guido anti-Guido and unpythonic. :-( Python supports breaking backwards compatibility when necessary. See, it's comments like this that got him locked in the dungeon via a palace coup last year.
OpenSUSE release numbers have gone in the last few years: 13.2, 42.1, 42.2, 42.3, 15.0
What developer doesn't want to think about what the version means? You can't just grab anything. 
&gt; Because that's what Guido said. That's why we got rid of Guido last year, remember? He abandoned the Zen Of Python so we had a palace coup. 
Second this. In that link, look for: &gt;Geopy can calculate geodesic distance 
cuz
&gt; The thing is that Python 3 wasn't really viable as a successor until 3.6 &gt;(released: 23 Dec 2016) I started using Python in 2012 and never even considered using Python 2.7 as opposed to 3. 
Job board is top post in this subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/avrws2/rpython_job_board
I learnt Python starting 2012. Around this time, not all libraries I would be depending on for my job had been ported to 3 yet, so it made sense. For the rest of my time in that job, even when the ecosystem became totally solid, there was an effort associated with porting our codebase over, so we didn't bother. When I started a new job in 2017, it made absolute sense to switch off the bat 
&gt; It means you are forcing consumers of your code to have one exact &gt;specific version of Python - 3.7. It's free; that's hardly a burden.

Looks like all of this can be done without metaclasses by using `__init_subclass__`. Metaclasses should be avoided I think.

I am the one who wrote the benchmark study ("Basic Comparison of Python, Julia, Matlab, ..."). Some of the source codes are available in the tar file at the bottom of the web page. I have submitted the necessary paperwork to make the project Open Source, that will more likely be available on GitHub. I hope everything will be ready in the next few months. I have many other cases that are not presented on the web page. &amp;#x200B; In my point of view, you need to pay attention to the introduction I wrote before interpreting the timing numbers. I did not attempt to optimize the Python codes. Better Python results could be obtained through limiting the memory usage, using (as far as possible) Numpy arrays, using Numba, rewriting loops, etc. I initially thought that I was not using a Python distribution with optimized MKL. After few exchanges with Intel, I realized that it was not the case. &amp;#x200B; I hope that when the project will be Open Source, you will all have the chance to directly contribute. My plan is to provide timing numbers at least once a year (assuming that there will be hardware and software upgrades).
I'm working on an encryption tool inspired largely by the Nazis' Engima machines. 
It's probably the case that `__init_subclass__()` combined with `__set_name__()` on descriptors would get there. But those features weren't added until Python 3.6, and Django won't be dropping support for Python 3.5 until Django 3.0 (expected late this year or early next year). So for the moment it's not possible for Django to just rip out the model metaclass and replace it with `__init_subclass__()`.
Yes, that makes sense. For anyone wondering why is better to do it the new way, metaclasses are a pain to combine whereas the new way uses regular inheritance rules. 
1. You already posted this. 2. /r/learnpython
Also education, embedded systems, and core mini sections of larger codebases.
And FWIW, I suspect that if we go down the path of replacing the model metaclass we'll probably have `Field` implement `__set_name__()` but also implement `contribute_to_class()` and have it proxy to `__set_name__()` for a while.
Totally agree with you— I’m not advocating a zombie existence. Maybe the larger takeaway from the comments I was bringing up earlier (despite the downvoting) is that the PSF should learn from how the rollout happened from 2 to 3 and take measures to prevent a similar event when the language will progress/upgrade in the future. 
&gt; One solution is to fork Python 2.7, and continue developing the language, adding features in a backwards compatible way so large, unportable (due to financial constraints) Python 2 applications can continue to evolve and improve and bring value to the people and companies that invested so much time developing them. This is the correct thing to do (actually, it would be best if Guido and other leaders in the Python community did this officially instead of forcing a fork). Features from Python 3 that can be backported to Python 2 should be, and a Python 2.8 release should be made. Those few who have actually spent time to write new software in pure Python 3 can use a tool like 3to2 to bring Python 2.8 compatibility. That is just a ridiculous argument. Especially since his whole point is that not many people had done the switch at this point so his libraries were not supported, so people shouldn't do the switch. It's a vicious circle, and the blogger doesn't even realizes that his point is flawed to its core.
In the words of Shaggy “it wasn’t me...” I wouldn’t be in favor of that. 
1: read the sidebar 2: /r/learnpython 3: read THAT sidebar 4: use that subreddit's search function
You can look at bokeh apps. 
Really nice work. Looks really nice. Is there a way to download this resume format?
Nice presentation. But I'd argue that there are only two actually "cool" features in that list are `yield from` and chained exceptions. The others are minor syntactic adjustments or standard library enhancements that were already available in other packages. In particular most matrix operations including matrix multiplication people still mostly do in `numpy`. As I mentioned asyncio was still highly confusing at 3.5 and got a much needed improvement. In short nothing that can justify a switch especially when python 2.7 was still had better performance compared to anything upto 3.5.
Oh wow, weird.... &amp;#x200B;
I understand, but I wanted to point out that this article had a lot of attention when it was published and it wasn't the only one of its kind. Zed Shaw [wrote one too](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/11/23/a-rebuttal-for-python-3/) with statements like "THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT PYTHON 3 IS SUCH A FAILURE IT WILL KILL PYTHON.... if you learn Python 3 then your future is very uncertain. You could really be learning a dead language and end up having to learn Python 2 anyway." This explains some of the negative comments you're seeing about Python 2.7 - a large number of people are glad that the calls to scrap Python 3 or fork Python 2 are (probably) going to be over. 
Scrapping doesn’t mean what you think it means. 
I've checked the author's Twitter account and he's a self-avowed communist, so he has a habit of endorsing failed ideas. :-)
You get some of the power of C and C++. Plus, you get to tap into cool libraries like TensorFlow, Sklearn, and Flux that facilitate analyses in a way that makes the code fairly readable. Compared to R, I like Python's syntax and DataFrame objects better.
I love this. Really well done. I saw a great pie chart on one of them. Apparently someone spend 30% of his time fucking girls........
I have a few people in my office i'd like to troll with this if i could download them as a pdf instead fo a screenshot
Haha yeah, but I actually want the template to use for myself 
A heads-up, your code font is too pale.
Python 2.7 really was an astoundingly good release. I think Python 3.4 was the first one good enough to replace it, but the principle is the same: it was really good for a _long_ time. That said, now that I've switched to 3 for everything, working with _any_ 2 release feels like a horse and buggy.
I predict it will also get really expensive really quickly. Red Hat will probably support 2 "for free" for a while, but eventually you'll have someone like Oracle selling costly support contracts for the few remaining organizations. I might be wrong, but that's my prediction anyway.
For the future - any cmd script will immediately close when it's completed, unless it is called from a cmd window that is already open. 
Thanks a lot for the reply. I had almost forgot about this. I also had a very poor attempt to collect some of the language benchmarks I could find in one place [here](https://github.com/Foadsf/LangBench). Sadly I did not finish this. Maybe you can use this and further develop your benchmark. I would be honored to help.
Wat
Yeah, legacy support usually becomes more and more expensive until maybe even a single (enterprise) customer might be financing the operation. People have had a 10 years notice to upgrade, if you cant do it within that time frame your business is probably not that viable to begin with.
IMO, there was nothing to _prefer_ about 2.7. It _did_ let you generally write buggy code that ignores the distinction between bytes and strings, which was often fine for internal stuff or for websites where you _only_ supported ASCII text. In those situations, it's convenient to forget that character encodings other than ASCII exist (up until the point where you have to acknowledge UTF-8, and then find that all your stuff breaks in novel and entertaining ways). For me, that's literally the only "advantage": 2.7 makes it easier to write buggy code, while 3 makes you pay attention to what you're doing. For one-off scripts, that makes 2.7 marginally easier.
Wait! Please 
Ewwww python 2.7. Good riddance.

Thanks, though it looks like it's a viz platform for numeric data and not necessarily a 'personal home page'. Unless I'm misreading. 
&gt;Incompatible versions should not be "versions" but treated like another project. Anything with the same name should be compatible. You're gonna start a whole new project if you e.g. just wanna refactor the interface of a class or two? And who's gonna maintain the old project then? Meaningful version numbers, e.g. [SemVer](https://semver.org/), solve this fairly well I think. &gt;Also,we should start evergreening everything as we can (this would be easier if the first point holds true). So everyone who starts an open source project is obligated to maintain it his whole entire life? Or even multiple "versions" of it according to your point above? If that's not what you mean, then every open source software is already evergreen, if someone is motivated enough to maintain it. You could be this someone. &gt;One of the ugliest and less elegant shit i've seen is angular 1-&gt; 2. It was "solved" with the whole angularjs != angular but damn. That really wasn't great because it almost had nothing in common with the first version, but that's a pretty rare case.
Do you know about the [regex library](https://pypi.org/project/regex/)? It's a drop in replacement for re, with more features.
There are other considerations, too: it _will_ get harder to hire willing Python 2 devs. It will eventually be in the COBOL niche where anyone willing to do it will charge you an arm and a leg.

There was no coup. Guido decided to step down because he was sick of the BS. He's on the steering committee. Heck of a coup.

I did. They won't fix it. I'm not directing the criticism at you man. You're the more knowledgeable developer here it just seems like a preference in the developer community for "sufficient" answers for the majority of programming tasks. It's just not the one my teachers would think is correct, or seems good for a language touted by some as "the best interpreted language for science"
if you can't come up with your own project idea, how could you ever come up with a real solution to a challenging problem? motivating yourself is half of the job
I called for a coup; there was a coup. 
It could always be worse. We could do a major version every six weeks regardless of what code changes, just to keep up with the cool kids. 
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. You can also ask this question in the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), a large, friendly community focused around the Python programming language, open to those who wish to learn the language or improve their skills, as well as those looking to help others. *** [^(README)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper) ^(|) [^(FAQ)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper/blob/master/FAQ.md) ^(|) ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)

Rename it from yourscript.py to yourscript.pyw and run it again.
I think we can just as well use 3.16 after that.
Yes, I don't understand his argument either. You kill a language by advocating against its use in the first place. I myself am pro py3, and whenever I absolutely have to write py2 code, it's dreadful. Having to deal with unicode, not knowing whether the division is true division or not, working with asynchronous threads, all of that is much easier with python 3, not to mention its greatest strength : f-strings.
100% of the codebase assumes that there's a GIL. You'd basically have to touch every file in CPython to remove the GIL. Doable, but excessively time consuming and error prone.

You my need to run it from a batch file that leaves the command window open after the program is done.
You may want to research "knowledge-based systems", and "expert systems" to get an idea of how to reason about this type of problem. As for programming paradigm, use the right tool for the job at hand.
&gt; But doesn't this assume that an increase in integer goes hand in hand with breaking backward compatibility? That is what semver is for, yes. Why bother having major and minor releases if the designation doesn't tell you anything valuable about the versions? The "4.0 comes after 3.9" thing is breaking semver, which is really valuable, in order to protect people relying on version strings instead of sorting things properly.
Could you just use rss feeds
- read the sidebar - r/learnpython - read the sidebar there - search that sub
emacs is my go-to when im using a linux system. but its good to learn nano/vim for those linux systems that dont even have emacs. 
 I learned Beautiful Soup b4, but I want to learn scrapy, and how to present info visually. I think this is going to take more than a week. :0
&gt; No customer would want to hear that we need to schedule 4 upgrades over the following years instead of one, it's just more time and money spent doing the same thing over and over again instead of doing it once. Said no software company or customer ever. Have you never heard of incremental upgrades? The "forklift upgrade" is so dreaded most places refuse to do it even in the face of end of life (they'd rather pay a team to maintain the old version). Even Microsoft, is selling Windows 10 the final windows version even if the twice-annual releases break things.
Arrays or lists, I use them interchangeably but you're right. Thanks for your suggestions.
&gt;I use them interchangeably Please don't. Some third-party Python libraries explicitly implement arrays (sometimes going to great length to ensure performance benefits). Both are specific tools for often disparate jobs.
Force of habit when used to C and Java, mixing numpy in there doesn't help either.
Python 2 to 3 isn't that big of an update.. Even looking at some fairly large code bases the footprint of the diff is usually not that big. I think I remember almost all the changes in the languages even now several years after the last time I ported a project over to py3.

I know numpy can do this with arrays of numbers (pretend att was a numeric value filled array): Import numpy as np subset = np.array(att)[ np.array(optimal_attribute) ] With a quick google, it looks like numpy can have arrays filled with strings but I've never done this. Something like: subset = np.chararray(att)[ np.array(optimal_attribute) ] 
Hello! You can use something like this: image\_bytes = requests.get(image\['src'\]).content with open(path\_to\_image, 'wb') as file: file.write(image\_bytes)
it depends on which version of 2. 2.7 to 3 is not huge (I did a port took me about a week, and in particular I was doing a lot of abstract syntax tree metaprogramming which required a bunch of updates to parsers). Version 2.4 to 3, now you're gonna have issues especially if you were leveraging things likes a particular MRO in old-style classes.
People suggest Spyder to be most similar to RStudio. So definitely check that out! Other options include PyCharm, Eclipse+PyDev and loads of other (google knows..)
You may want to look at Spyder or JupyterLab. They'll de most or all of what you want, with various limitations. Please be aware that it's possible to connect an IPython QT window to a running Jupyter notebook if that's useful to you. I'm not certain if it's possible to attach a Spyder session to a running notebook, but it's worth looking into. Normally, when I'm working, I'll have a Jupyter notebook for the project I'm working on and another "scratch" notebook with snippets and pieces I'm trying to figure out. This works well, with broad browser support.
No mention of a company name or compensation package? No link to a job posting? What is this, even?
It is, but it has the hability to build complex dashboard as well, and integrate well with microframework like flask. https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html#building-bokeh-applications
