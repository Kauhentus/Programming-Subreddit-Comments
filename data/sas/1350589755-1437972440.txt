Do you have any programming experience other than the 1.5 years of SAS? Do you have experience in a particular field that uses SAS software? SAS hires subject matter experts for fields they are doing work in, and having SAS coding experience is usually a requirement.
Which university/region?
University at Buffalo. Though I am willing to relocate basically anywhere
I used this [book]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1599941651). It was really easy to learn, I just followed the book and typed in the example programs. It also comes with data sets and program examples on a disk. 
If she has an educational license through her school she can access some excellent introductory e-learnings produced by the SAS institute at support.sas.com/myelearn. They're free for students.
International knowledge measurement (IKM) test is pretty much the same as the certification (edit - I mean in terms of the questions not in terms of the final qualification/certification) If you can find a way to do the IKM Test at home your post test report will sum up your strengths and weaknesses. Will probably cost to do this however - SAS mock exams are also very good. The exam really isn't that hard though.
I didn't take any class before my base certification, but it's a "tricky" test that includes a lot of arcane techniques, I.e. way too much around importing text files and dataline creation. Lots of gotcha type questions. Take as many practice tests as you can.
I'm also learning through self-study--mind if I ask what you use for practice? I've been trying to track down the "student" version of SAS to practice with, but they don't seem to offer it on their website any more.
I haven't started yet and I'm trying to figure out if I get the year license and a book on learning sas then ill be able to pass the certification or if I should just bite the bullet and pay for the expensive class. 
I'm taking one of the SAS e-learning courses at work for review (I'm a SAS programmer). It has quizzes in between the lessons and the questions are not hard, but definitely tricky. The e-learning courses are actually really good, but very expensive! 
The base SAS certification exam had a lot to do with reading in flat files and basic data step programming. I am a SAS programmer and did not think the base exam was challenging at all. That's not to say you shouldn't study or anything like that. I'm just trying to say that if you look at the concepts required, it's not that much relative to what you probably do in your job day to day.
good teaching
Hey there! Heck, I forgot I subscribed to this subreddit. I've used SAS at two different companies for three years, one being retail and the other being the healthcare industry. In both situations, it seems to be the company's solution to perform analytics on data housed all over. Most of the work I've seen doesn't use many of the procedures other than proc SQL. Haven't bothered with a certification yet, there's so much demand for analytics that anyone with any SAS experience seems to get through to at least an interview. What's got you studying for the exam?
Coder for a bank here. Visited SAS last year, beautiful campus. I do data, trend, and risk analysis using Base SAS and did the Base certification last year. The test is largely obsolete compared to my environment, I'm not sure if that's everyone's experience but it was mine... Currently looking for a new company to bring SAS to or contribute to an area focused on coding.
Anything specifically you didn't like? I've been looking forward to [PROC JSON](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/64787/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0ie4bw6967jg6n1iu629d40f0by.htm) for a while now.
Did a VA install on 9.4 was pretty good, however it takes forever to start the Web Services. 
There were so many output bugs with 9.3. Tagsets excelxp didn't work, the ability to call excel VBA from SAS broke...
Ah, I didn't deal too much with ODS... but if you can show me it reproduced, I'd be happy to see if I can help :)
Are you SAS tech? I worked with them for a few months and got a workaround for the tagsets, but the VBA scripting still is broken. I was assured that nothing could be done.
Sorry to hear that... I'm not a SAS tech, but I know some people with tech support.
What's your favorite part so far?
Metadata server clustering! That is going to be sooooo nice.
Work for SAS tech support. Opinions are of course my own :) rsix8t: How did your certifications go?
There is a preparation guide from SAS that covers everything you need to know for the exam: [http://support.sas.com/publishing/cert/](http://support.sas.com/publishing/cert/) I powered through the book in the 2 days leading up the exam and managed a pass.
Clever use of proc groovy! I had always avoided that one.
Can't tell if you are serious or if this is sarcasm... If you were serious what didn't you like about SAS 9.3?
You can see my other replies in this thread. 
Worked in SAS over the past 10 +. Years Large utility company PC SAS 9.3 right now. Let SAS be SAS. Use pl/sql with ODP.net in c# and c++ We do short term forecast models and customer class profile generation and analysis. Tons of adhoc analysis for various financial and system issues related to energy flow and consumption. 
Actually, you're probably lucky you didn't get any error messages, as I've found that SAS error messages are generally so indirect, useless, and vague that they are actually worse than nothing at all.

I love the fact that it is still possible, several generations of hardware later, to get a 'Dropped card' message in the SAS log following an error in a datalines statement. I prefer to think of SAS error messages as subtle hints rather than explicit directions. Most of the time they boil down to problems with one of 3 things: * The data * My understanding of the data * Missing bracket or semicolon, usually somewhere near where the first error occurs
The best thing is when you miss a semicolon or a closing string delimiter, and you get some bullshit error message, and from that point on *every single code submission* results in an error, even when it's perfectly correct, because somehow the compiler is stuck in a particular state and it won't resolve until you log off and restart the session (talking about SAS EG here). Genius. 
Hey.... I work in IT as a sysadmin and my company is currently in the process of implementing SAS 9.4. I would be grateful if someone could point me in the direction of some courses/tutorials online so that I could better prepare myself to support SAS. THANKS!
My wife is working on her masters in healthcare informatics. She's taking an SAS course right now. I will be posting questions from her in the near future.
so part A and B want you to create a new data set using the data in the HRv5Sim.txt file. You do this using a data step. Part c wants you to calculate a new variable using existing variables in the HRv5Sim.txt file. You can do this in the same data step you use in part a and b. I think this [link](http://www.cpc.unc.edu/research/tools/data_analysis/sastopics/datalib) should get you through a and b. Play around with part C. The statement needed here should go between your set and run statements. Don't forget your semi-colon. Part D is ambiguous. There are lots of ways to 'display' each variable. My guess is maybe they just want you to open your new data set and make sure your code is working correctly. 
A million thank you's! I understand that perfectly!
In my experience they take even rather trivial requests quite seriously - I reported an issue with the factorial function in 9.1.3 which they said they'd fix in 9.4 (it was demonstrably wrong once you got much past 20! due to using single-precision arithmetic).
I'd say the canonical option for viewing the contents of a dataset in SAS is via proc print. There are lots of additional options you can use, but the most basic syntax for proc print, after you've imported your dataset from plain text into SAS using a data step, is simply as follows: proc print data = mylib.MyData; run; This displays the entire table YourData in the output area of your (interactive) SAS session. For portability, you can divert it to pdf or html using ods, e.g. ods listing close; ods pdf file = "C:\temp\output.pdf"; proc print data = mylib.MyData; run; ods pdf close; ods listing; A lazier option is to open the table in a ViewTable window within SAS. You can do this either by double-clicking on it manually from the explorer panel, or by running a dm statement: dm log 'vt mylib.MyData' continue;
Thanks, I completed the assignment and am now using the code as you put it for kicks.
That makes a bit more sense - a lot of health institutions have been using SAS for quite a while now. There are also some very specific SAS-sponsored degrees - I once met someone who graduated from a credit risk analysis course (and is currently in charge of credit risk modelling for a UK mobile phone carrier).

upvoted for relevance
SAS/ACCESS is a client based access tool, (DESKTOP). You can access any database system as long as you have the appropriate driver sets. With VA you can also access any db yet it also has extensions to sas server which is a tool to interface from server to server and provide a large multi user platform. Cost are a lot different as well. we pay $250K / 100K year maint for 12 licenses (desktop) VA with a Server is 1.2 M.
SAS/ACCESS is label for SAS software products that will allow the number crunching part of the SAS solutions to access data stored in relational databases or similar systems. For example there is a product called "SAS/ACCESS Interface to Oracle" this product allows the SAS software to natively read/write data in Oracle databases. SAS Enterprise Miner is a software tool to help streamline the creation and deployment of descriptive and predictive models. If your data that you hope to use in your models is stored in a database then you might need both an ACCESS product and EM. The best bet would be to get in touch with your local SAS Office. They can run through it with you in much more detail. http://www.sas.com/contact/intro.html 
There are many ways to skin a cat. The key to any implementation is the quality of the data. If you data is stored in a meaningful way then it is fairly trivial to implement some fantastic reports in a much more modern way. Its got the added advantage of being alot more scalable and secure. While the transition might be trivial it might take a little time. In the long run moving to a Metadata driven model will save you many headaches when it comes time to get the system upgraded. The longer you feed the spaghetti code monsters that can be some SAS/Intrnet application the harder it is to modernise.
Have a bit of a read through SAS 9.4 Intelligence Platform: System Administration Guide. http://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/intellplatform/index.html Hopefully this will give you a bit of a feeling for the vocabulary and what things are and where they fit into the grand scheme. The other trick I found was to have a little skim of the contents pages of the administration guide so I have a rough idea of where I should be looking. The best place for formal training is from SAS. I'd get in touch with your local SAS office. They will certainly be able to help you arrange some online training or even perhaps a classroom course.
Here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your school/work or is unavailable for any reason: #***Foul Bachelor Frog*** &gt;***Post Title:*** *I'm off on holiday next week...* &gt;***Top:*** *USES OPTION DKRICOND* &gt;***Bottom:*** *CODE WORKS, SOMEONE ELSE CAN FIX IT LATER* [Original Link^1](http://imgur.com/fOn61WV) | [Meme Template^2](http://imgur.com/memegen/create/fOn61WV)
I'm not such a pro with PROC SQL, so here's something that will do what you need in a slightly different way: %macro splitTable; %local i teams team; PROC SQL noprint; select distinct columnA into :teams separated by ' ' from work.tableB; RUN; %do i = 1 %to %sysfunc(countw(&amp;values)); %let team = %scan(&amp;teams, &amp;i); DATA table_&amp;team; set tableB (where = (columnA = "&amp;team")); RUN; %end; %mend; %splitTable; If columnA is a numeric variable, you'll need to remove the double quotes in the (where = (columnA = "&amp;team")). Also, splitting data sets is usually unnecessary in SAS because almost every procedure can be run with a by-statement to run analysis by unique values of a given variable(s). You may have already thought about that and decided this is still the way to go, but just thought I'd point that out since you said you were new to SAS. Let me know if you have any trouble getting that to work, or have any other questions! 
Using a macro increments data in a loop. That's the only way that I have really done incrementing in SAS. 
Just curious. Where does &amp;values get set in this code? 
Oops, that should be &amp;teams. My fault, I rewrote part of it after I typed it out and forgot to change that one.
I don't think so, since one line usually does one thing in SAS. You can create a multidimensional (n x 25) temporary array in one line though. If n is the number of variables you need in each of your 25 temporary arrays: array vars (n, 25) _TEMPORARY_; It doesn't actually create 25 temporary arrays, but you can reference them as 25 different arrays by changing the first index.
Are you familiar with macro loops? Here's the basic structure of what you want to do, where you would need to replace what's in the square brackets: %macro runTables; %do id = 1 %to [number of ids]; ods text = "Table &amp;id"; [your table code for this id] %end; %mend; %runTables; If you're not familiar with macro loops, you might need to read up on them, or post a more complete sample of your code and data.
Try this: ods text="8 out of %sysfunc(strip(&amp;num)) ratings contained";
fantastic thank you very much. I use strip when assigning a value to &amp;num so i'm not sure why this issue occurs exactly, but this worked great!
Probably can do something like **x_1 = substr(x,1,200);** **x_2 = substr(x,201,200);** Something like that.
Do you have an upper limit, or should the code be able to handle *n* characters?
Please excuse my ignorance, but I am not sure what you mean?
Thanks! What I am hoping for is for the program to find all variables that are over 200 chars and create and split them into 200 char variables. Is this even possible?
I doubt there is any simple way to do this in a single data step, but it should be fairly easy to automate if you don't mind making 2 passes through the data.
I definitely don't mind making 2 passes through the data.
Ok, have fun with this. It should work with any number of character variables, producing the minimum number of additional variables required for each one as per your limit. For testing purposes I've split to 2 characters per column. /*Generate dummy data for testing*/ data have; set sashelp.class(keep = name); eman = reverse(name); run; /*Set max chars allowed per column*/ %let CHARS_PER_VAR = 2; /*Get the number of character variables present in input dataset - negligible time required*/ data _null_; if 0 then set have; array chars[*] $ _CHARACTER_; call symput('CHAR_VARS',dim(chars)); stop; run; data _null_; /*Make initial pass through input to find max length of each variable*/ if 0 then set have; array chars[*] $ _CHARACTER_; array lengths[&amp;CHAR_VARS] _temporary_; do _n_ = 1 by 1 until (eof); set have end = eof; do i = 1 to &amp;CHAR_VARS; lengths[i] = max(lengths[i],length(chars[i])); end; end; /*Generate output dataset*/ call execute('data want(drop = j);'); /*Put the columns in viewing order*/ call execute('informat '); do i = 1 to &amp;CHAR_VARS; vars_needed = ceil(length(chars[i])/&amp;CHARS_PER_VAR); call execute(vname(chars[i]) || ' '); do j = 1 to vars_needed - 1; call execute(compress(vname(chars[i]) || j) || ' '); end; end; call execute(';'); call execute('set have;'); do i = 1 to &amp;CHAR_VARS; vars_needed = ceil(length(chars[i])/&amp;CHARS_PER_VAR); call execute('array ' || compress('out' || i || '[*]') ||' '|| compress('$'|| &amp;CHARS_PER_VAR) || ' ' || vname(chars[i]) || ' ' || compress(vname(chars[i]) || '1-' || vname(chars[i]) || vars_needed - 1) || ';'); call execute('do j = '|| vars_needed ||' to 1 by -1;'); call execute(compress('out'|| i || '[j]') || '= substr(' || vname(chars[i]) || ',' || &amp;CHARS_PER_VAR || '* (j-1) + 1,' || &amp;CHARS_PER_VAR || ');' ); call execute('end;'); end; call execute('run;'); run; 
If length(x) &gt; 200 then &lt;something&gt;;
You want to check out this [link](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/faq/sasgraphs.htm). Your FILENAME statement is telling SAS to save your scatterplot to the directory and filename in the quotes. Here is another [link from the SAS User Guide.](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_odsgraph_sect011.htm) Also, check out this [link](http://support.sas.com/techsup/technote/ts674/ts674.html#IV). To make the scatter plot, you use PROC CORR and PLOTS= option specifying SCATTER. You will see examples in the links above. There are some great tutorials on SAS' ODS. Try looking for UCLA's ATS SAS resources. If you're still stuck, post again and I can point you in the right direction.
Thanks--not sure how I missed this, I use UCLA's ATS resources often. I appreciate the help!
What have you tried so far? Since this is homework I'm not inclined to do the whole thing for you, but if you want an initial hint I'd suggest looking up the tranwrd function. Also, is the text you've provided an exact copy of the source (i.e. with everything on one line), or is each row of the table in the html in a separate line? That will make a bit of a difference to your solution.
Ah it is actually line by line reddit made it one line. I took the text used find all to highlight all the &lt;tr&gt; and replaced them with no space which gave me just the plane text. SAS isn't compatible with my computer so I can't do mucglh more till I get to school. 
Ok it was actually a lot Easier than I anticipated. I imported the HTML code to excel find all &lt;*&gt; replace all no space copied the info back to note pad imported that to sas and ran it like we have learned to do. 
I work in SAS but don't work with time series data. My advice would be to check out the SAS resources at UCLA's ATS IDRE. 
What error messages / warnings are you getting when you try to run your code? Proc expand requires a particular module (SAS/ets), so if you don't have that I'd expect to see something along the lines of 'unknown proc'. If all else fails, you could always write some data step code to do the same thing - this would be a bit more fiddly to set up, but it will work even if you only have base SAS.
Here's a data step example: data test; do _n_ = 1 to 20; x = floor(ranuni(2)*10); output; end; run; data want; set test; array xlag[5] xlag1-xlag4 x; xlag[1] = lag1(x); xlag[2] = lag2(x); xlag[3] = lag3(x); xlag[4] = lag4(x); x_movavg_5 = mean(of xlag[*]); run; 
Thank you... I think this must've been the problem. I retried this on my school computers which have a more updated version of SAS and it seems to be working. 
Actually, perhaps I spoke a little too soon. This code does work, but it does something a little strange. It creates a new column in my data table with the exact same name as the old one, which contains the moving average values. So now I have to columns, both with the same name.... 1 with the original data, and 1 with the moving average. Anyway to give the moving average a different name within the code?
thanks gonna check 'em out when we dive a little deeper into SAS 
i also saw this the other day. do hope its not about SaaS but about the statistical analysis software. also hope discussion picks up a little, it's a bit slow here...
Should be the statistical software -- any posts about "SaaS" should be downvoted.
+365
Hopefully, this [helps](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/sas_launch.htm). If not post again. 
I think it looks really good. The post is clean and straightforward. Although some more screen shots might be good for people looking to replicate what you did. Seeing is always helpful. I had not heard of SAS Web Report Studio before. And now I want it. That looks way better than my difficult (albeit really fun) endeavors in ODS HTML + JavaScript. 
Thanks, appreciate it. I'm finding my way around a few different things so I have a couple more SAS posts lined up. The screenshot I used is actually SAS VA (Visual Analytics), not Web Report Studio. The concepts to get Oracle data in a SAS format all apply in the same way though. (Full disclosure, I work for SAS, although this is the first I've started using the technology)
I've never used this before but the site seems useful. Thanks!
Edit, I've narrowed it down to a problem with formatting. I would recommend anyone who use this to format immediately before running the macro and not attempt to call formats from a library. Not sure why this is causing problems but it is for some reason. 
Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Preferences General tab Uncheck "Submit contents of file opened" I hardly ever double-click a SAS file to open it. If you drag-n-drop it onto a Program Editor window, SAS will open the file in a new window. I'm not sure how I figured that out, but it's my habit now.
Are you on Windows 7? Ever since my work switched to windows 7, I have all kinds of issues with stored templates and formats.
Visual Analytics 6.3 (the version that came out December 2013) can embed reports from Web Report Studio.
Don't forget about anydate.w it's amazing! http://pramod-r.blogspot.com/2010/07/got-dating-problems-use-anydate.html 
I don't think you can do that with your query. With the code you submitted proc SQL has to determine the average amt of each date so input date like this 02AUG2013 5 02AUG2013 7 will result in a set like this 02AUG2013 6 02AUG2013 6 That's what your note is telling you, that it had to calculate the average amount, and then perform a join on date. If you want JUST the average amount for each date (produce only 1 row per date), then you'll need to select DISTINCT date, avg(amount) as amnt. What output are you expecting?
Both computers that I ran the code on were windows 7, but it worked on the first one. Still never fixed the problem, was putting so much time into it that it made more sense to do the tables by hand.
I think OP is referring to the title specified for the subreddit. When I am on the front page of the sub my browser tab reads "Software As a Service".
I probably should have used a better dataset for an example. I am expecting it to give me what it resulted in. But I want proc SQL to simply never automatically re-merge data back and instead give me an error message. Reason being, when I forget to group by an specific variable and use a summary statistic, I'd rather just have it not run than to find out via the log. It's all about data integrity. If I want a summary statistic there, I'll join it myself. I don't know of any other SQL program that automatically joins a statistic back to the data, so to me it seems a bit nutty. 
http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/61895/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a002473699.htm Specifiy the NOMERGE options in your program. If your administrating other users, specific it in the autoexec_USERMODS file. 
We unfortunately don't have our results posted anywhere. Like I said, it's not flashy or extensively impressive, but it's decent work of a number of procedures. If you're attending the global forum, we'll be there today, and on Tuesday we will be poster number 1814 at 10:30. We graduate in June. I can't speak for my friends but I have already enrolled for college course, however I am looking for any contacts I can make. 
I've been wondering the same thing. Also, why is it labeled as "Software As a Service"?
Thanks for the info. A friend and I were thinking of doing that but we suspected we wouldn't really have time for it. Plus, we're fairly novice level.
I was just poking around and found this. I've done some mod stuff before and thought it would be nice to get this updated. If the request goes through, I can add you as a mod if you'd like. 
I can mod. I run /r/surveyresearch, where 99% of what I do is just deleting spam and directing lost souls looking for /r/samplesize. 
I would probably write at the top in big, bold letters: "Never paste code into your editor and expect it to work, even if the program runs without an error." Then the rest of the sheet would be links to the SAS support site for common procedures. They would probably be grouped by stages of what you expect them to do (e.g. data management, variable checking, analysis, etc). I think there are two dangerous potential problems with a cheat sheet. First, I rarely give a colleague or student code and it work unless they really understand what is going on. The best case scenario is that they are aware of their errors. The support site is great and it really helps to read and understand what is happening when you give SAS a command. Second, there is more than one way to skin a cat. Giving someone instructions is encouraging them to follow what is on the sheet explicitly and can hamper innovation and learning, which are some of the more rewarding parts of coding. Sure it took me a while to learn, but trial and error taught me so much. 
The first and last item would be Have you remembered the ; 
Proc SQL syntax
Macros are not magical, they are text and are usually quite stupid (meaning they do no thinking). PAY ATTENTION! Always check at least 10 lines ahead when you get an error. Pay very close attention to your semi-colon use. If your designing stored process based web applications I would sit them down and explain that you NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER, put an unquoted macro variable into code, EVER! I've had to mention that last one to experienced SAS users who just never seemed to "get" SQL injection. 
Google.com
I was thinking 1) simple Proc SQL syntax, with INNER JOIN TBL ON instead of WHERE a.key=b.key 2) a Proc Contents varnum example with ODS OUT are must-be examples. And 3) maybe all the different options you can use when referencing a dataset. ie, work.test(keep= drop = obs = etc..). 
Dude. I wish I had seen this a couple of months ago. My company paid for the materials and test I took for certification. I do not need the materials anymore. I could have donated it to you. I gave it away! I would say, and this is something a friend told me so I'm not really sure, that search for sample questions on the internet. Apparently a lot of chinese websites release tons of these questions and going through those questions helps a lot. If I could give away some free advice, not that you are asking for it, definitely read about memory allocations etc. Like, eg: using a scan function will allocate 100 bytes etc.. things like that. I remember seeing a lot of questions like that in the test I took. Good luck with your test!
I can't stand EG. It seems slower to me than pc SAS. 
Let's not forget those of us who still run SAS in batch, non-interactively, on Linux. I wonder how many mainframe users there are out there.
Have you looked at [this](http://www.ualberta.ca/~ahamann/teaching/renr480/SAS-Cheat.pdf)? 
It's my understanding that it works best in a network environment with many users. 
Are you talking about the colours of text in the advanced editor, or colours in SAS/graph output?
Do you have screenshots for why the colors are jacked? Perhaps logs? Lastly are you 100% sure that SAS Graph is installed?
Ohh, also check to see if you can get what you want by changing the ODS STYLE. 
Yes, definitely sure SAS/Graph is installed. I'll see if I can get some screenshots. It's stuff like, if you change a color to a "named" color, like setting the foreground color to "red" or background to "blue" - some of those colors don't work, others do.
Do you have the same issue if you use the equivalent rgb / hls codes?
Was this due to auto-conversion in MS word? Using notepad or pretty much any other text editor avoids this problem.
I wrote it in notepad 
Good call thanks 
This seems like the most straightforward way. Also, if you knew what the last letter was then you could create a do loop using lag variables, but it would be simpler to transpose.
I can see why you might not want to go down the transpose / array route - either you use proc transpose, which is very inefficient, or you have to make an extra pass through your data to work out what the longest final concatenated word will be before you can define an array, or else make an assumption. Here are 2 different ways of doing it without using tranpose / arrays, assuming that you want to loop through your whole dataset: data have; input letter $1.; datalines; h e l l o ; run; data want; length word $5; do until(eof); set have end = eof; call cats(word,letter); end; run; data want2; length word $5; retain word; set have; call cats(word,letter); run; The first one generalises slightly more easily using by groups if you want to re-start concatenating at various points in your dataset. I'm not sure why call cats works this way when none of the more familiar concatenation operators do, but it does and that's what matters. Can any more enlightened SAS folks comment?
You mean run; ?
A few assorted things that I might have found useful: A list of which procs require: * run; quit; * quit; run; * run; You can use format / label statements in virtually any proc rather than running an extra data step, and that as well as doing this instantly, proc datasets also lets you rename variables and datasets. If your code doesn't work, look for the first warning / error message in the log and try to fix that before getting bogged down in any subsequent errors. Quite often one error early on will trigger many others, making the situation look much worse than it really is. The compress function is very useful for checking whether strings contain particular characters - it has many commonly overlooked options. Also, I'm not sure whether this is still necessary in SAS 9.2+, but you can restore syntax highlighting within macros by adding the line %let DUMMY = %nrstr(%mend); at the top of the macro, just after the %macro statement. This makes it much easier to spot syntax errors within macro code (the %nrstr masks the %mend during macro compilation, but the highlighting engine doesn't know that %nrstr does this and is deceived into thinking that it's reached the end of the macro).
LOL - Brilliant! 
Pirate bay? Ask SAS nicely? 
If you're using it for teaching &amp; research purposes, and are affiliated with a university or school, check http://www.sas.com/analyticsu
That would work, and your second method was my initial answer too, however it breaks if letter is a space. Also, you probably only want to output one row at the end, hence the last line of my block. data want; length word $200; retain word ' '; set have nobs=nobs; substr(word,_n_,1) = letter; if(_n_==nobs) then output; run; Most people forget that in SAS, [substr works on the left of an assignment too!](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000212267.htm). As far as I know, this neat feature is unique to SAS and Perl.
Yes, substr is the way to go if you need to preserve all possible characters. Incidentally, the first method I gave (DOW-loop) also only outputs 1 row. Silly option - replace spaces with null characters while you're concatenating, then replace them with spaces again at the end: data want; length word $11; do until(eof); set have end = eof; call cats(word,tranwrd(letter,' ','00'x)); end; word = tranwrd(word,'00'x,' '); run; This now preserves spaces, as call cats doesn't strip null characters, but now it breaks if your original text contains any of those... 
Could you post an example of the desired input and output? It's a bit tricky to get an idea of what you're asking for from what you've posted. I don't use IML myself - if I needed to do something like that I'd probably do it using arrays and bits of macro logic.
Is this the sort of thing you had in mind? No IML - treating variables as column vectors: data vectors; input vec1-vec3; datalines; 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 5 ; run; data want; array sums{3} sum1-sum3; array vectors{3} vec1-vec3; do until(eof); set vectors end = eof; do i = 1 to dim(sums); sums[i] = sum(sums[i],vectors[i]); end; end; drop i; run;
I was in the same situation as you. When I first started my job, they wanted me to learn SAS, but they didn't want to provide any training. My co-workers were awesome, but not helpful when it came to programming. I found that the best way to get familiar with SAS is to start fooling around with SAS Enterprise. You should be able to figure out how to read your data in fairly easily, and then use the menu options to create whatever it is you want to create - bar charts, maps, line graphs, etc. If you need help with this first part, pm me and I can give you more detailed directions to get you started. Once you have done the above successfully, hit the run button. This will give you your results (for example, if you told SAS to graph data, then a graph with your data will pop up in the output window, assuming you did everything correctly). If you navigate to the tab called "program" it will show the program that SAS enterprise wrote to accomplish the task. Playing around with the code that enterprise writes for you, and viewing the results, is the best way to get familiar with SAS programming. Here is my blog http://cbeconomics.blogspot.com/ If you see anything on it that you like, I would be happy to send you the code I wrote for it so that you can fool around with it. I've only been doing this for about a month. So I still have a lot to learn. If you really get stuck, write an e-mail to sas help. Send them your code and your log, and they will write you back and help you fix it. Also, check out Robert Allison's SAS site (http://robslink.com/SAS/Home.htm). He is awesome at coding. You can look at a collection of his works there to get an idea SAS's capabilities. The best part is that for every example he has, he gives you the sas code. Copy, paste, and play with the code to make it work for you. Its so freaking awesome! SAS also has quite a few tutorials that they have put out there to help people learn. Do some google searches for what it is you want to make. Chances are that the staff at SAS has produced a how-to guide for what you want to do. Good luck!
hmmm I've never seen the notation vec1-vec3 and the array commands in the data step... Thanks this should be pretty helpful. No way that you know of of doing something similar in iml I assume? even if not this should be pretty helpful for a start. I think I can sorta envisage a way of getting around most problems where the number of vectors changes using macros. Using something like %macro example(firstvec, lastvec, firstsum, lastsum, n); data want; set vectors; array sums{ &amp;n} &amp;firstsum - &amp;lastsum; array vectors{&amp;n } &amp;firstvec- &amp;lastvec; do until(eof); set vectors end = eof; do i = 1 to dim(sums); sums[i] = sum(sums[i],vectors[i]); end; end; drop i; run; %mend; data vectors; input vec1-vec3; datalines; 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 5 ; run; %example(vec1, vec3, sum1, sum3, 3); proc print data=want; run; data vectors; input vec1-vec4; datalines; 1 1 1 4 2 2 2 5 3 4 5 6 ; run; %example(vec1, vec4, sum1, sum4, 4); proc print; run; Thanks a lot. I still need to go through some of the commands to make sure I understand properly but this is pretty cool.
Can you provide an example of what you would use SaS to do at your current work place? What would make me choose SaS over excel if im just outputting charts to place into a power point? It seems excel formatting looks neater then the more pixelated SaS charts. Thanks for the reply, I will definitely just start playing around with it. My manager used to work with SaS and wants me to start learning it. so far all the skills I've learned were self taught and on the job. If I have any questions I'll def reach out to you. Thanks again. 
thanks. It seems my lack of formal training in SAS is starting to catch up to me as I want to do more and more complicated things. You've been very helpful though. thanks so much
If you just want to make charts and dashboards, then excel is all you really need. I work with a group of economists, and they all use SaS or eViews to do complex modeling. I know excel has some simple tools to do regressions and what not, but when you are working with models that use about a hundred data sets with multiple variables, then you really need a program like SaS telling the model where to pull the data from, which points to use, and how. SaS is also great for organizing data. Say you have a bunch of raw data. You can write a program in SaS to tell it exactly what data points you want to extract and how you want the data you are extracting to be presented. For example, I have friends that work at companies who perform massive surveys. So, when they get all the data back (literally millions of responses) from the surveys, its their job to extract, organize, and analyze the results. Being good at SaS helps immensely. My co-workers have written programs, which I run, that do this. I am no where close to being a pro at this yet. Right now, I'm working on mastering the maps and graphs functions within SaS. SaS has some pretty awesome ways to visualize data - there are interactive capabilities, and time lapse capabilities, that I'm not sure excel has. 
One last thing, if you work at a company that has the financial resources, you should ask your boss if (s)he would consider sending you to SaS training. The people I know that have done the courses rave about them. Plus, you can earn several levels of certification. The classes are pretty pricey, so if your company provides you the opportunity, take it. 
We're releasing SAS University Edition later this month, which will include base SAS (9.4) and a bunch of other stuff for free. [Check it out!](http://www.sas.com/en_us/offers/14q1/122603-sas-for-academia/overview.html)
I know this is a SAS sub, but do you know much R? ggplot2 can do this without much hassle. 
http://robslink.com/SAS/democd7/aaaindex.htm Check out example number 3. For the percentage you'll need proc annotate.
Sounds awesome!
Robert Allison is one of the most amazing SAS graph experts I've ever seen. You should check out his blog for additional examples. [His training blog] (http://blogs.sas.com/content/sastraining/author/robertallison/) [Additional Examples] (http://robslink.com/SAS/Home.htm) People think SAS is ugly, but that's not true, it just takes a little more work to make it pretty
Sas outputs the computed p values and not a decision about significance, what's the issue?
So, when doing the factorial design because there are 3 hypotheses to test in the book I am reading says that three different significance values must be set for each one. I wonder if this has to be specified in SAS. I am very new to statistics like I said and mostly self learning. So maybe this is a stupid question. Sorry for that.
I work in the education space, so here are some datasets using education data... but data is data, so the same could be applied to medical data if you knew about it. How about a macro that takes all of [these national datasets](http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp) or [these california datasets](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/ap/apidatafiles.asp) and pulls them together? The problem with them is that they have **mostly** common fields, but they're suffixed with the year they come from, so simply PROC APPENDing them together won't work. What I did was loop through each table, query the dictionary tables, remove the year from the end, and created a PROC SQL statement from that that UNION ALLs them together. It could be done in static code, I guess... but it's the kind of thing that a macro is ideal.
Ha! Thanks; I work in EDU as well. I get the "data is data" thing - even said that phrase before myself. 
Install SAS Enterprise Guide, and start playing with that. If you connect it to a server, it won't cost your organization an additional license, which can sometimes be a barrier to entry. Some things you can do to get started: * You can drop your Excel files right into a program flow and it will import them into SAS datasets * Take a look at the "CODE" tab of the Import task; or any task really. This will show you the SAS code that was run to do it. * Create some graphs from that dataset. Again, take a look at the CODE tab. Tinker around with the options. * Play with the Query Builder. This is essentially a point-and-click SQL editor, and if you have experience with SQL, joins should come naturally. It's useful for doing quick queries, although once you can code SQL, it's probably quicker just to type it out. * Figure out how to create a library that connects to your SQL server. * Capitalize it correctly; S**A**S. This avoids confusion with the much younger buzzword SaaS (Software as a service), or the CSS preprocessor SASS. And be sure you pronounce it as one word, and *not* S-A-S.
There is an option in the preferences of EG to prevent it from showing the output of a task after it runs.
I'm not sure how access works in this regard when importing from SAS. SAS has no concept of Booleans as a separate type - there are only character and numeric variables. You could create a character variable with text values 'Yes' and 'No' (or 'TRUE' and 'FALSE') in SAS and see if Access is clever enough to auto-convert it to a boolean for you, or you could run a query in access to create a boolean from the numeric variable you've already populated in Access.
That same example actually covers it for you (assuming that you have the *SAS/ACCESS Interface to PC Files* installed): /*Assign a sas library called db pointing to your mdb*/ libname db 'c:\myfiles\mydatabase.mdb'; /*Create a SAS dataset in your work library*/ data test; mark=1; output; mark=0; output; run; /*Copy it into your access mdb with a further data step*/ data db.Newtable(DBTYPE=(mark='YESNO')); set test; run; I think you might be able to do both of the above in one step if you preferred, i.e. data db.Newtable2(DBTYPE=(mark='YESNO')); mark=1; output; mark=0; output; run; 
We have team members in India that use this, but it's pretty unimpressive for reporting. I imagine once we buy Visual Analytics that we'll totally scrap WRS altogether. 
We still crank out SAS Intrnet offerings..... It's a royal pain the rear. I'd be happy with Tableau, etc.. 
Interesting. I've never tried that. Nothing jumps out but I will play around with it. Any particular reason you're not using proc transpose?
 proc transpose data=have out=word; var letter; run; data assembled_word; set word; final_word=cats(of col1-col5); keep final_word; run;
For small datasets like this one there really isn't anything wrong with proc transpose. If you want to transpose multiple variables within by groups from a very large dataset, data step techniques can be more efficient.
Awesome. Thanks!
Glad to help. You mentioned that you are reading from Excel. I assumed based on your code that you are saving the Excel as CSV prior to loading it into SAS. Did you know that if you have the right SAS product (Access to PC Files) that you can access the Excel worksheet directly? This would save a step. If you don't know if you have the product or not, please submit this code and check the log: %put NOTE: Result=%sysfunc(sysprod(ACCESS Interface to PC Files)); If the value in the log is 1 then it means you have the product licensed. If so then I'd happily show you how you can use it. 
Smart move on their part, but is it 5 years too late now that many college students and professors have started working in R/Python? I think SAS didn't take open source seriously enough and is now playing catch-up.
Do you guys have SAS Management Console installed? You can view the activity under the Server Manager node if you do. 
You could just ask the users, are you still using SAS?
Thank you so much! :D It was some time ago but that question was still bugging me. 
I might download this just to play around with SAS Studio. Despite having thousands of SAS users, my company is a little behind on the adoption curve.
Here are a few examples for you: data example; set sashelp.class; /*Using if / then / else*/ if SEX = 'F' then NEWVAR1 = 'A'; else NEWVAR1 = 'B'; /*Using ifc (requires SAS 9.1 or later) - use ifn for creating numeric vars*/ NEWVAR2 = ifc(SEX = 'F', 'A', 'B'); /*Using select / when / otherwise */ select (SEX); when ('F') NEWVAR3 = 'A'; when ('M') NEWVAR3 = 'B'; otherwise; end; run; ifc/ifn use the same syntax as the excel if function, but they differ slightly in the way they function - *value-if-true* and *value-if-false* are both executed before SAS chooses the result, which can result in phantom error messages being printed to the log, whereas in excel only the required part is executed. 
I'm not familiar with ifc, but your first example looks good to me. I typically pull out a sample database and play around with that if I'm not sure about my code
I think the first method is more straight forward, the only thing I would add is a) be careful of your 'else' statements. If your variables get complex it can be harder to keep track of what you're not doing than what you are. b) You can use the 'in' command to specify a list, like this: if var1 in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) then var2=value; Might save you some coding. If this is helping, I would suggest looking at the syntax for using it in combination with the "substr(" command. Its a little more flexible. 
Yes, I agree and this is a very good illustration. I had only meant that specifying every variable is nice because the "." is easy to find in a frequency table or to recognize that it has been left out of an analysis. A lot of students I have helped with SAS have run into issues with forgetting about one small but important line, and with the else statement it gets grouped in a way that makes it difficult to determine that a simple mistake has been made. 
excellent - this was very helpful! It helped me work out the little bugs in my program
Finally. I'll register.
I thought I did (I created a library in the explorer window and put in the path to my dataset) but it's telling me that my library doesn't exist and that the variable "notrealvariable" (as listed below) cannot be found. Here's an altered version of my program: libname fakedata 'E:\My Fake Documents\Madeup\Fake\Name'; options nofmterr fmtsearch=(library); data temp.temp; proc freq; tables notrealvariable; run; Thoughts?
If libname fakedata 'E:\My Fake Documents\Madeup\Fake\Name'; doesn't work, I would check if I put in the location correctly. As a side, that location would not work in the university edition
I moved everything to the C drive. When I click on the library folder in Explore, nothing appears, even though I gave it the path. It still can't find the variable, either. My formats program and regular program are both open. Do I need to close one or the other, or perhaps have my data open somewhere?
1. If you open the library via the libraries icon in SAS after you've assigned it, can you see your dataset there? If not then you've probably mistyped the path. 2. What happens if you try running the following? `proc freq data = fakedata.yourdataset; table notrealvariable; run;`
it depends so much on your actual setup... On my work SAS lives on a external computer, it cannot even see my local drives. The SAS university edition lives in a virtual computer, it can only see things under ...\SASUniversityEdition\myfolders . In general the drive where SAS lives should work. To quote the manual; &gt; The following LIBNAME statement writes the active librefs to the SAS log: &gt; libname _all_ list; that should give a clue
Ok, I tried adjusting the path name so now it's a C: file ending in .sas7bdat, to which it said "ERROR: Library fakedata is not in a valid format for access method RANDOM." It also said "ERROR: Error in the LIBNAME statement." (this is new) Then, it said "ERROR: Libname fakedata is not assigned." I tried your "proc freq data = fakedata.yourdataset" and it said fakedata.yourdataset was an invalid dataset name Then it said, File WORK.FAKEDATA.DATA does not exist (I think it's trying to put the dataset into WORK in the libraries because it couldn't get it to go in my FAKEDATA library. And, lastly, it said: ERROR: "No data set open to look up variables." Something ain't right : / 
Ok. It's listing off a bunch of C: drives, so I guess we're on the right track.
You should only include the folder in the libname statement where you're assigning fakedata, not the full file path.
OK. I've adjusted it back to the folder. It now says My data set does not exist, "ERROR: There is not a default input data set (_LAST_ is _NULL_)", and "ERROR: No data set open to look up variables." 
Would it be problematic if other items were in that folder? Should I make separate folders for each thing?
Ok, I checked on all that and it looks good. Still hates it and says it doesn't exist.
Underneath that bit there should be some further output that looks like this, showing you the datasets contained in the library: Member File # Name Type Size Last Modified 1 HAVE DATA 5120 22JUN2014:20:52:01 2 WANT DATA 17408 23JUN2014:18:13:36 Do you see anything like that? 
I didn't see anything like that. I'm on a college library computer, so maybe it just really doesn't like its local C drive? Should I just try it from the desk top?
It looks like you're running SAS inside some sort of virtual machine that has its own C drive, separate from the one where you've saved your sas dataset. Try the following: filename cmd pipe "dir /b ""%sysfunc(pathname(fakedata))"""; data _null_; infile cmd; input; put _infile_; run; This should list in the log the contents of folder you've assigned to the fakedata library. If it doesn't list your dataset, SAS simply can't access the location where you've saved it. Can you browse to any other SAS files from the library computer from outside of SAS, which you can also find from within SAS? If you can, save your dataset in one of those areas. If not, you'll need to ask your system administrator or someone else who uses SAS at your location how to transfer your file to an area where SAS can see it.
I changed the file locations, and I can see the dataset in the library/explorer window in SAS. However, now it's just saying: ERROR: File WORK.FAKEDATA.DATA does not exist ERROR: There is not a default input data set (_LAST_ is _NULL_). ERROR: No data set open to look up variables. Is this where I give up and go get a beer?
Ok. It said file not found :( I'll try to figure something out. Thank you kind stranger for all of your help.
Just to confirm - in the explorer pane, you've clicked on Libraries, then the icon for Fakedata, then you can see your dataset? Also, let's say that your file is saved as Z:\path\to\your\folder\yourfile.sas7bdat, and you've assigned the folder as a library called fakedata. Can you confirm that you're writing the proc freq code like so? proc freq data = fakedata.yourfile; table yourvar; run;
Yes, I can see it. I get: ERROR: File WORK.FAKEDATA.DATA does not exist. ERROR: No data set open to look up variables I'm now working from a flashdrive instead of the weird local drive and I'm still getting this.
Please could you post the proc freq code you're using verbatim? It looks as though you aren't specifying the name of the dataset properly.
Glad to hear it! And, yes, I'm not sure why it has taken so long for anyone to propose this kind of service.
http://www.safaribooksonline.com
It seems like it didn't like the way a few of my files were named. We didn't figure out how to get the formats to align but I am at least able to open the data.
Try something like this (assuming that you're talking about values of one variable that are wrong, and you want to apply the same logic for any non-integer scores below 4): data want; set have; newscore = ifn(oldscore &gt; 4, . , oldscore - 1); run; Alternative syntax: data want; set have; if oldscore &gt; 4 then newscore = . ; else newscore = oldscore - 1; run;
I'm a bit more of an advanced user, but if you can make a video that explains proc transpose *and helps me remember it next time without having to look it up, and then experiment until I get the output I want,* I'll consider you the greatest SAS instructor ever.
Thanks! I really appreciate the feedback. I was hoping to start working on building up the statistics series soon (a set of videos highlighting a lot of different statistics and how to perform them in SAS) but some of the procedures you mentioned weren't ones I thought of. I'll be sure to include some videos on those soon too - thank you!
Lol - yeah transposing's a pain! I'll work on this next and PM ya when it's out!
Ha, every time I do a proc transpose I end up writing an extra data step to clean up the mess I made. 
You've got the right idea about automation, but ODS html is not going to produce a .xls file. There are at least two ways of doing this that *will* work, however: 1. [Use DDE](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/hostwin/63285/HTML/default/ddeexamples.htm#exddewrite) 2. [Use the excel libname engine](http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi31/024-31.pdf) They both have their advantages and disadvantages. If you just want 1 table per worksheet, libname excel is probably simpler, but if you want to work with a more complex layout DDE might be the better option. This can all be done in base SAS - no need to use enterprise guide.
I do this all the time! Look up DDE, and when I'm at my computer I'll write a more detailed response.
I am going to try this tomorrow at work! I will get back to you guys
I will give this a try tomorrow!
Here's a quick code that I use to quickly output the average age by year. Hope it helps! *Average Age by Year; proc means data = HAVE n mean std min median max nonobs noprint; var AGE; class YEAR; output out=Age(drop=_type_ _FREQ_) n = n mean = mean std = std min = min median = median max = max; run; proc transpose data = AGE out = AGE (drop = _LABEL_) prefix=YEAR_ ; OBSERVATION_ID YEAR; run; filename temp_out dde "excel|Sheet1!r2c2:r2c5" notab; *you have to have an excel sheet named 'Sheet1' open; *you have to know where your data is to be written, here row 2 column 2 through row 2 column 5; data _null_; set AGE; file temp_out; Put year_2008 '09'x year_2009 '09'x year_2010; *you have to know the exact variable names to write; *put '09'x between variable names to prevent delimiter errors; run;
ODS tagsets.excelXP will do exactly what you're looking for. You can write to different tabs within an excel sheet, and you can completely customize the deliverable... Auto filters, color schemes, etc. support.sas.com/rnd/base/ods/odsmarkup/excelxp_help.html I can post example code when I'm at my computer tomorrow!
Everything Enterprise Miner does is just code sent to SAS on top of a slick interface. This is probably not the best way, but you could take the code that EM runs and run that in Base SAS, then wrap it in a macro.
Please could you post a few sample lines from the data set and your code so far?
Sorry, extremely sensitive information in there. Really just need to know if there's a way to specify multiple lengths for the same variable
Feel free to replace anything sensitive with dummy values if that helps, including the variable names.
I found a solution. I had been writing to a remote server rather than my machine. All I need to do is ftp and transfer the files ;)
*The solution* *64-bit SAS cannot write to 32-bit Excel. *I have since wrote CSVs *The files write on the remote server rather than my machine. I all I need to do is ftp them to my computer! 
Figured it out. Apparently it can't typecast old variables, but I can create a new one.
Congratulations! Nothing is more rewarding that solving your own SAS problem! ^^^that's ^^^a ^^^lie
Yeah, of all the programming languages I've learned, SAS has been the hardest. The documentation is weak, the syntax is bad, and the semantics are confusing. But damn does it feel good once I finally figure it out!
Check this thread. It has one suggestion for a fix and a contact email at SAS technical support if that doesn't work. https://communities.sas.com/message/213488#213488
Big thanks. That looks like the exact issue I'm having right now.
Looks good man, keep up the great work.
To make matters worse I actually need to move over 5 or 6 associated variables: So for every date1 and date2 there is a 1stvar1 1stvar2 2ndvar1 2ndvar2 3rdvar1 3rdvar2 It is for only 37 IDs out of a dataset of 15000. I am very close to just doing this manually but I'm worried that I will cause an error.
Edited - moved DESCENDING keyword on sort. * Check mytable1 after sort - ensure second measures come first; PROC SORT DATA=mytable1; BY ID DESCENDING Start1; RUN; DATA mytable2; SET mytable1; BY ID; RETAIN start5 start6 start7 start8 end5 end6 end7 end8; IF FIRST.ID THEN DO; start5 = .; start6 = .; start7 = .; start8 = .; * Fill in for END&lt;n&gt; vars here too; END; * Only write the record (output) if this is the last occurrence of the ID; IF LAST.ID THEN OUTPUT; ELSE DO; start5 = start1; start6 = start2; start7 = start3; start8 = start4; * Fill in for ENDn vars here too; END; RUN; 
No every date is different 
If it's only ever a max of two lines for an ID, personally I'd split and merge. proc sort data=mytable1 out=mytable1a nodupkey dupout=mytable1b; by id; run; data mytable1b; set mytable1b; start5=start1; start6=start2; start7=start3; start8=start4; *same for end5-8=end1-4; drop start1-start4 end1-end4; run; data mytable2; merge mytable1a mytable1b; by id; run; 
One difficult thing is I actually 7 associated variables I also need to move. This is a simplified version. Today I have my data so it looks like this: ID Start1 Start2 Start3 Start4 Start5 Start6 Start7 Start8 End1 End2 End3 End4 End5 End6 End7 End8 1 . . . . date5 date6 . . . . . . stop5 stop6 . . 1 date1 date2 date3 date4 . . . . stop1 stop2 stop3 stop4 . . . . 2 . . . . date5 . . . . . . . stop5 . . . 2 date1 date2 date3 date4 . . . . stop1 stop2 stop3 stop4 . . . . 3 date1 date2 . . . . . . stop1 stop2 . . . . . . 4 . . . . date5 date6 date7 date8 . . . . stop5 stop6 stop7 stop8 4 date1 date2 date3 date4 . . . . stop1 stop2 stop3 stop4 . . . . 5 date1 date2 date3 date4 . . . . stop1 stop2 stop3 stop4 . . . . I tried your method as follows (on the original table, not the one above): DATA Table2; SET Table1; BY ID; RETAIN date5; if first.ID then do; lineend8 = .; end; IF LAST.ID THEN OUTPUT; ELSE DO; date5 = Date1; END; RUN; Unfortunately this just did date5=date1 for the entire dataset. Also I need to move 7 or more variables as well, so date5=date1, stop5=stop1, assocvaruno5=assocvaruno1, assocvardos5=assocvardos1, etc. I was able to move all of this using an array but still trying to figure out how to conveniently move this information down.
If I merge it I only want to merge data that isn't already present in the original rows. Is this possible? I actually need to move over 7 different associated variables with each date(i) and stop(i).
It should be fairly straightforward to extend the idea of my code to however many variables are necessary. The general idea is to use proc sort to strip out the second lines for everyone, rename the variables (1-4 become 5-8) so that they don't overlap when you merge back in, and then merge back in.
I have some character variables, I'm not sure if that would work? I used the lag function after making sure everything was sorted correctly and that seems to have worked.
OK, a mistake I made is placement of DESCENDING above. I have shoved everything into ARRAYS. Your example does not initialise date5 but instead has lineend8. Also the PROC SORT is critical for the BY clause to work in the DATA step. The BY clause allows the FIRST and LAST functions to work properly. PROC SORT DATA=Table1; BY ID DESCENDING Start1; RUN; DATA Table2 (DROP=i); * Format line below is only to force a proper order, you need to ensure type is correct; FORMAT ID BEST12. start1-start8 date9. end1-end8 Date9.; SET Table1; BY ID; RETAIN start5 start6 start7 start8 end5 end6 end7 end8; ARRAY src{8} start1-start4 end1-end4; ARRAY tgt{8} start5-start8 end5-end8; IF FIRST.ID THEN DO; DO i = 1 TO 8; tgt{i} = .; END; END; * Only write the record (output) if this is the last occurrence of the ID; IF LAST.ID THEN OUTPUT; ELSE DO; DO i = 1 TO 8; tgt{i} = src{i}; END; END; RUN;
Why do they run it on Virtual Machine? On my machine virtualbox caused "blue screen". It's a problem of virtualbox, but anyway, it would be much more convenient to use SAS Base in a conventional way.
My instinct was to saturate it: Y = X1 X2 X1*X2 X1*X1 X1*X1*X2 X1*X1*X1 X1*X1*X1*X2
I have this a lot and have never found a better/faster solution than the exact one you are currently using i.e. opening in notepad++ and replacing, however I'm dreading the day in which I get a file that's too big to open and do a search/replace. Because of this I haven't yet used the following advice so would appreciate if you could update if it works (I can't check it right now) * http://support.sas.com/kb/41/116.html * http://support.sas.com/kb/26/065.html
The first link there had the solution for me. I had to do a bit of tweaking, but I ended up with data _null_; infile 'test.csv' recfm=n lrecl=50000; file 'testout.csv' recfm=n; input a $char1.; if a = '"' then do; d+1; if d = 2 then d = 0; end; if a = "," and d = 0 then do; c+1; end; if a = '0A'x then do; if c = 2 then do; c = 0; put '0A'x; end; end; else put a $char1.; run; The `a = ","` keeps a counter of how many variables I've read in (`d` is making sure I don't include commas inside strings), then `if c = 2` adds line breaks after every 3rd variable (since `c` starts at 0). Thanks!
Excellent!
You can also get windows parallels too
Sorry you were having problems and glad to see you found a solution! Is everything working okay now? If you haven't already registered, please join the SAS AnalyticsU Community for resources and discussions with other users. https://communities.sas.com/docs/DOC-5604 
Interesting, thanks for the tip! I eventually finished, but took almost 2 hours compared to the 3.5 seconds it takes for the an ARMA(1,1) structure.
Please don't turn this subreddit into another recruiter's resource. LinkedIn is available to you Ashley for exactly this kind of recruiting. 
Perhaps too late, but I was browing /r/SAS and couldn't resist trying a solution. It looks like any ID with more than 4 values gets a new line for some reason. Would love to know why the data is structured like that, but whatever. So if all your variables follow the same structure then I think this should work: **Get first record for each ID** DATA x1; SET orig_data; BY ID; IF first.ID; RUN; **Keep Second record and rename vars** DATA x2 (rename=(start1-start5 start2=start6...end4=end8) drop=cnt); SET orig_data; BY ID; IF first.ID THEN DO; cnt=.; END; cnt+1; IF last.ID and cnt&gt;1; RUN; **Merge the two files** DATA x3; MERGE x1 x2; BY id; RUN; If you have a third record for the ID, you can just change the cnt condition to cnt&gt;2, cnt&gt;3 etc. 
No need for two steps.
No need for the extra variable - just put one function inside the other, e.g. year = year(datepart(EnDate)); Alternatively, don't even bother creating a new variable at all! If you just want to summarise by year, you can do that using only the existing datetime variable, by applying the dtyear. format within the summary, e.g. proc summary data = yourdata; format EnDate dtyear.; class EnDate; var Othervar; output out = summary_dataset n=; run; 
Perfect! Thanks so much!
This works. Thanks so much!
Good point.
Entry-level positions typically don't assume this knowledge (although claiming familiarity or working knowledge gives you an edge). You can just learn the ropes during the induction process. Of course learning on your own is possible, it's tough to direct that process without knowing how it will be used
Which branch of psych? Unless it's Quant, you'll probably be fine with anything decent. I used my old T61. Just graduated in cog aging last year. Just get something with 8 gigs of ram to be safe and get an Intel cpu bc a lot of stuff is not multi threaded. Oh, and Windows x64.
One can do parallel processing in SAS, but I wouldn't worry too much about that in the context of a laptop. As per /u/neoporcupine's comment, in that scenario it makes more sense to connect to a remote machine to do your processing.
alright I used proc sort to do it, but would still like help troubleshooting the proc sql version Code that worked proc sort data=data1 out=temp; by investigation_ID; run; data unique; set temp; by investigation_ID; if not first.investigaion_ID and last.investigation_ID; run;
Nice! Did you mean to say that you are 'trying to delete all the repeated **observations** in this dataset? Deleting duplicate variables is not what your solution suggests. Proc sort has a few extra options that might make your life easier. Proc Sort data=data1 out=temp nodupkey; by investigation_ID; run;
You need to use *, rather than investigation_ID, in the select statement so that SAS knows you want all of the columns.
Thanks! I'll try that!
My interpretation of the question is that the input is essentially a text file, with that data. EG: 10, 3,7 ,.,CT The question is asking how many tokens will SAS split this into using space as a delimiter, or comma as a delimiter. A token being the variable determined. So for comma, it would be 10, __3 , 7_ , ., CT_________ Quick SAS Code to see this output; data test; infile datalines dlm= ','; length e $11; input a b c d e; datalines; 10, 3,7 ,.,CT ; run; change the dlm option to ' ' to see what happens when you use a different delimiter. You might also find a read of some freely available whitepapers such as: http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi29/253-29.pdf helpful for learning the beginnings of SAS. Also take a look at these free elearning courses for beginnings of SAS Programming and Statistics: https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us
Hey can you please define variable in a little more detail? I am still confused as to what the token is in this situation, would it be the delimiter in use? Or is it asking how many variables will have data on them? So for the code you suggested, I would have observations in variables a,b, and c?
I interpreted it as the tokens are what SAS reads in before moving to the next variable. So with a comma delimiter, you have 10, 3, 7, ., &amp; CT which in my code were input as a,b,c,d&amp;e respectively. However, the tokens are not what is written to the data table. The tokens contain the entire data being read in. So for the case of b, the token is 7 _ _ (where each underscore corresponds to a space). What the code I wrote does is: creates a data table called test, by reading in the datalines supplied at the bottom. It defines the variable e as being a character (the $ notation) of length 11. All the other variables are left as default, which is numeric 8 bits which is plenty for the majority of numbers. It then reads them in, stopping its read at each comma. You won't see the underscores in the output table because for a numeric, leading and trailing blanks are removed. I'm not sure if I am just confusing you more or if this helps. To briefly define the terms: Token: What is read into SAS for a given variable, before being converted and saved in the specified/default form Delimiter: The character in the input text that SAS recognizes as where to stop reading in the token. Variable: The saved version of the token that is placed inside the data table at the end of the data step. It is saved as either a character or numeric variable, and if incorrectly defined can have truncation or rounding issues.
Good to hear you were able to ask and answer your own question! SAS docs are where I find most of the answers to SAS issues, either that or Premium Support (who are genuinely fantastic, if your organisation has bought support - use it!) Just something for future - when I'm having problems with SAS metadata library objects; particularly those going to SQL/Oracle, I tend to try and write the libname statement in Base SAS/Enterprise Guide/DI Studio (use a user written code transformation). This allows me to get the connection established, and ensure that it all works (i.e. there are no network issues preventing me from assigning a library on the other server. Once I know it works, I can reverse engineer the configuration within Management Console (I assume this is where you are assigning your metadata server objects) and DI Studio for the library (though I tend to do them both in SAS MC). I realise for your example that wouldn't have helped a huge amount, as it was solely an AuthDomain issue, but thought I'd share what little I could after the fact. Best of luck picking up SAS!
I'm not sure about proc means / proc summary, but this is something that should be fairly simple to do via proc sql: proc sql noprint; select hhid, inctype from yourdata group by hhid having inc = max(inc) ; quit; I'm assuming that you only have one row per inctype per hhid...? By default proc sql will do a sort even if the dataset is already sorted, so for large datasets you can save a bit of time by making the following tweak: proc sql noprint; select hhid, inctype from yourdata(sortedby = hhid) group by hhid having inc = max(inc) ; quit;
&gt; I'm assuming that you only have one row per inctype per hhid...? Not necessarily. So if I were to do it in SQL, I'd have to do it as a subquery doing a sum(inc) grouped by hhid inctype and then your suggestion.
This is correct, sql is the way to go. You cannot do it in one proc means.
The advantage of SAS over R is customer support. Try contacting the people at SAS for help if you can't solve your problem here. 
I'm a little confused, I think. Let's say there are two type of income, inctype = 1 or 2, and similarly two people in a particular household. If the breakdown looks like this: person inctype inc 1 1 1000 1 2 0 2 1 1000 2 2 1500 So for this household, the largest single contribution to income is person 2, inctype 2, but the _total_ value of inctype 1 is 2000, more than that of inctype 2. I want the code to return inctype 1, but my understanding would be that the suggested code given would see that the largest record comes from inctype 2 and return that.
This was a great question, thanks for posting!
What makes you think that having one dataset per make of car is a good idea? It is almost always simpler in SAS to keep everything in one big dataset and use by group processing (or a class statement where available) if you want to summarise things for each group.
 where make_cd = "&amp;name";
Something like this works as long as your list never changes. A solution with proc sql, select into and a macro loop of listed values handles it. However, I do agree that it might not be the best idea to separate everything to a new data set.
I need to create separate csv files to be distributed to different groups and each group can't have access to the other group's data
this worked. thanks! I had tried this with single quotes and it didn't work. Didn't occur to me to try it with double quotes.
thanks! lenwad's answer worked.
I agree. I would definitely select distinct make_cd values into a macro variable. I just wanted to provide the correct syntax to OP's existing code. 
 proc sql; select distinct make_cd into :letter_list separated by "," from one; quit; 
This is surprisingly tricky to do with SQL, as the operation you're interested in is somewhat contrary to the design of SQL at quite a fundamental level. If you have multiple records per ID, it's somewhat arbitrary which row you join back on - there is no well-documented way of accessing row numbers via proc sql. If you use `select distinct * `, proc sql returns every combination of all your variables, which isn't what you want. `select distinct ID` will give you the full set of distinct IDs, but not the remaining columns. To replicate what you get from `proc sort nodupkey` you can select distinct IDs in a subquery, then join on the other variables. Using a `having` clause does the same thing without the need to explicitly specify a join. You need a way of reliably selecting exactly one record for each ID, and your dataset might not contain any variables that enable you to do this. However, you can cheat by using the undocumented `monotonic()` SQL function, which behaves much like `_n_` in a data step: proc sql noprint _method _tree; create table class2 as select *, monotonic() as row from sashelp.class group by sex, age having row = min(row); quit; Here, instead of ID, I'm using a combination of sex and age. `monotonic()` can cause some strange things to happen if you use it in more complex queries, so it might be safer to use a slightly different approach, e.g. assigning a random value to each row and selecting the minimum. 
Macro stuff within single quotes doesn't get processed, stuff in double quotes does. I can never remember which is which so I usually have to do something like %put "&amp;this" '&amp;this'; to check.
I'm not going to do your homework for you, but you should be able to work out the answers from the [documentation for the input statement](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/a000146292.htm#a000207333). If all else fails, try running a few test data steps with different combinations of options.
Building on this a bit further, remember that it's possible (and faster) to output to multiple datasets in the same data step. So you could then do something like this: proc sql noprint; select distinct compress(make_cd) into :letter_list separated by " " from yourdata; quit; That gives you a space-separated list of potential dataset names that you can feed into a data step that generates all your datasets in one pass. 
I wasnt expecting you to, I just needed someone to direct me to the correct place to read up on it. Thanks@
Thank you. I'm not familiar with this function at all. Where do I name the new variable?
I think what kulmbach meant to type was: ones = tally1 + tally2 + tally3; zeros = 3 - ones; No function needed, and you don't have to declare variable types in SAS. What are you actually trying to do with these variables, though? proc freq and proc summary let you analyse frequency across combinations of variables.
 I will be using the new variable in proc freq and proc means. So because of this I wanted one variable where I would have the final values, per say. Thanks for the clarification!
Thanks! Haven't had time to sit down and play with this yet, but I will.
Thanks! Last week's homework took me 60 hours. I still failed. I'm the only person taking the class who is not familiar with programming, so the TA decided that he will not be coming to campus to waste his time. This week's homework starts off asking us to read in the SIPP data, save it to a location, set the lib name sasout to watever works, and use this file for the rest of the work. I don't get it. Why am I reading in the file, to save it to another place, to read it in from the second place? I could just use the first place and get the same result. I can't get anything to save into my library to even begin to try and call it.
I say post away to everyone here, we could use some good QA posts - we're all here because we like SAS and want to talk about it :) 
There's more than that: you're forgetting IML and SQL! :)
Is the SIPP data a SAS dataset or some other format like excel or .txt? Algorithm: 1. Assign libname for the location of the data to be read in. 2. Read the data into the work directory. 3. Analyze the data. 4. Output the result. Type this statement in SAS and let me know if it works or you get any error? Libname readin 'c:/ path of the SIPP location'; Data sipp; set readin.SIPP; run; 
PM me if you want some 1:1, I don't mind introducing the software to beginners.
At least someone in the world likes it. Seriously, if I can ever figure this damn program out, I'm going to teach it. Too many people know how to program, but teach terribly. I suck at programming, but can at least teach once I learn it. I keep frustrating the assistance because I want to know "why" not just "here's the code copy it." 
It's the SIPP data set, right from the website. It's the SAS code file and the wave1.dat file. I have no problem doing 2-4. I've done that a million times. Why do I want to establish the libname in the first place? There's nothing in my library. Step 2 reads the data. So am I just rearranging where the data is being read from and why would that even matter?
Your videos are actually really nice looking. Closed captioning is actually funny to try to decipher :) 
Well the instructor wants to teach you all the possible tools in SAS, how you use it in future depends on the needs and requirements of where you wish to apply. So if the homework says create a libname , then the TA wants to see if you can import a data from website and store it in a local folder. 
I've taken classes at the SAS Institute - I assure you excellent SAS teachers exist - but they're in the private sector.
That makes sense! is there any advantage as far as processing speed? 
&gt;if I ever figure this damn program out... I've been working with SAS for years and I can say that you'll never get it fully figured out. If I could give past me some advice, it would be: ALWAYS include annotated notes about what you are doing and why. You are going to learn a lot of different ways to do things and sometimes it's not easy to figure out what the heck you were thinking at a later date. You'll find yourself saving and reusing a lot if code so this is important. I learned SAS with actual data. Not only is it better to encounter problems that you will have with real data, but the why of what I am doing was always easier to understand. I knew my data, and the things I was doing took on more relevance. Errors are more like puzzles or challenges than annoying red text. It's also more rewarding to have made progress on a project rather than be relieved to not have to do homework anymore. Learn formatting early. It makes things so much easier but can be frustrating to get started with. Get familiar with the SAS online help. It's great. You will learn a base level of knowledge about data management in class, and the spend the rest if your life teaching yourself. Get started with SQL and macros early. Just like it's easier for a child to learn a foreign language, it's easier for you to integrate these topics into your learning than to go back and learn them once you know the basics. This one may be controversial, but part of me wishes I would have invested more knowledge in doing my statistics and graphing in R and using SAS more strictly for data management. But who knows, this could just be a grass is greener type of thought. Anyway hope this helps. Good luck and feel free to PM if you ever have any specific questions. 
fwiw, you can actually do quite a bit without ever using Macros, IML, or SQL.
I think your "desired output" is wrong; from what you said, AllStates should be something like "AZ,CA,NM" for user 1, "NM,MA,TX,CO" for user 2, etc. Assuming that's the desired result, my intuition is to use retain, although there might be more elegant ways. data desired; set original; by userid; length allstates $ 20; retain allstates; comma=','; if first.userid then allstates=state; else allstates=cats(of allstates comma state); if last.userid; run; (edited because you need a "length" statement to ensure Allstates has enough room for the longest concatenated string)
Accessing data from work library is faster than from your own library which will be faster than accessing data from a website. You can check CPU time and real time in the log. Also all this depends on the size of the dataset. 
hmm, catx. interesting. good solution!
Way I look at it, SAS is an operating system. The OS has a macro language, tabular data processing and loads of programs it can run (PROCs). Two of those PROCs, IML and SQL, form languages of their own.
&gt; because we like SAS We do? I use it at work and tend to disagree. I have often the feeling; Must have seemed a good idea 40 odd years ago, but I don't think they saw all consequences at the time.
Oh really? I love it! I'm stuck with PL/SQL at my new job and I feel like my hands are tied after using SAS.
&gt; There has to be some logic as to why I'd use one function over another even though both are likely to work Well... not necessarily - sometimes it really is just user preference. You could use PROC SQL to do 100 things, and you could use the data step to do those same 100 things a different way. Sometimes there are efficiency differences, or simplicity differences, or code readability differences, but 9 times out of 10 - it's what the programmer *wants* to do. The thing I hate the most about programming classes is that they teach from the code up. And personally, I think that is completely backwards and so not helpful. In real life, you have a problem to solve and you need to figure out how to code your way to a solution. You don't have a function and go "ok, let's get this PROC MEANS to work", you have a data set and you go "Uh, what's the average of this column..." My recommendation - copy and paste some code into SAS and just start playing with it. Think of some results you might want to see and start seeing how you can get there. "OK, this works, now what if I wanted to round all of the numbers two decimal places" or "but what if I wanted that column to be a row?" Google it - copy and paste what you find on the internet, and then make it work with your data. And then make it work again for something else. And again. And now you can code :) 
I never used PL/SQL so I don't have an opinion. But compared to R, in SAS I feel my hands are tied. (Now we can just wait till somebody comes along and tells that Python is much better ;) ) 
Ah, yeah, R has some serious advantages in terms of simplicity with statistical analysis, but I don't like trying to manipulate data in R. If your data is pretty from the start - R is the winner. And the program itself is light and fast. But if you need to do some wholesale data conversion and then stats on top of it, and then change your data more, and do more stats, SAS makes that whole process easier IMO. But I started with SAS and am heavier on the data manipulation side of things, so I am definitely biased :)
I can do basics without, but I know they are useful.
Awesome. Thanks. When I'm off mobile I'll check it. I dropped my sas class today and I'm now doing an independent study in sas. Our uni has a partnership is sas (20 miles away) so I can do the basic is free, but my project to show mastery is now to create a learning journal. Boring, but useful reads will be welcome.
I actually dropped the class today, so the specific question is moot now, but I'm still trying to grasp concepts. I'm going to do it independent study through the learning moduels. I understand why I need to access the file in a library, I could already do that. I'm just confused why I would write a data step to access the file elsewhere and move it. Could I just not move the file to begin with? Am I thinking just way too simply about it?
This can be done in one data step via a dow loop: data have; input userid state $2.; cards; 1 AZ 1 CA 1 NM 2 NM 2 MA 2 TX 2 CO 3 MS 3 AK ; run; data want; length states $ 32; do until(last.userid); set have; by userid; call catx(" ",states,state); end; drop state; run; I'm assuming the the input dataset has already been stripped of duplicate states per userid.
Sorry you dropped the class. At work I have to read in dataset from one location perform analysis and then write it to a different location. So in order to perform my task I would need to know how to read and write datasets. Think of it like this, we can walk, ride bicycle or drive a car to go from A to B. We learn all three but chose one based on distance. 
I would test reading in a few records from the dataset first. Also check if your university has SAS Web application or if you can find a computer that has it installed then it would be easier to read in. 
That's the problem I'm hailving. I don't see the point of learning a way if I would do it another way, it works, and doesn't frustrate me... especially if there is no an advantage
It's ok. I'm taking the moduels through SAS now, so I'm still doing it but with less of a timeline. I took the class because I wanted to learn, but I think I've learned more in this thread.
We do, but actually, my laptop processes better. I live with a programmer and have a good machine... we have just agreed that he can't help me with HW and remain married.
That's good. Good luck. 
:) wise man. Good luck. 
My first inclination would be to use first. last. processing. data test; retain UserID State newState; set originaldataset; by UserID; if first.UserID then do: newState = State; end; if ^first.UserID then newState = newState || ", " || State; if last.UserID; keep UserID newState; run; Something along those lines. 
Thank you very much, this works perfectly.
Dang, I keep forgetting that || concatenates. And I do this all the time. 
You were right that i messed up my "desired output" table, thank you.
Clearly we disagree. I believe *in R there is no* if *you can do something, only how*. And SAS, not so much so.
Lol. I'll try not to be snarky too. I see the argument time and time again. That being said, I agree that R has some AWESOME potential to outdo
Its a big list: the three variables used here are: F1: Name of person (30-35 indivudals based on Queueworked) Credit Line: Value of Credit line given to someone( 300 -50,000) Queue worked: Applicants are put in a queue based on other criteria and this indicates which queue this was placed in. (We can just call them Queues A, B,C, etc) Its just a big list of stuff like: Bob 15000 a Sally 300 b Jim 2500 a Sam 600 c Does that make sense? Then its ju 
I'm not aware of any option in proc glm that will do what you want. I think your best bet is: * Summarise your dataset to find out how many entries each name has in each queue * Work out which names you want to exclude for each queue * Create a view of the original dataset for each queue keeping only the relevant names for that queue * Run a separate proc glm for each view I suggest you read up on how to write macros as that will make this much easier. You might also be interested in proc glmselect.
You can use ODS PACKAGE, or preferably FILENAME ZIP with a data step if you have SAS 9.4. Google "FILENAME Statement, ZIP Access Method" - examples at the bottom of the page.
thanks, I'll look that up. Edit: ODS Package worked after getting the hang of it!
It's also fairly straightforward to have SAS call 7-zip via the command-line-interface. That gives you access to all of the usual options for creating zip files provided that you don't mind writing a bit of macro code to construct the zip parameters.
So you can use the cat function to concatenate two variables into a new one. I'm not quite clear on if you want the output to be in best12 or the date as attached to the sex in best12, though. The former is impossible - a variable with character must be stored as character. The latter would be solved by using a put statement to put the variable in a particular format, so: newvar=cat(sex,put(birthyear,best12.)); Hope that helps.
add an order variable to data set 1 (i.e., my_order=_N_; ); then sort each data set by color, merge by color, and re-sort by my_order. 
Thank you for your help!
Perfect! Thank you so much!
Thanks. Great answer! Idk why I said best twelve... What is "put"? Oh, also, I wanted to combine two or more categorical variables (Asat, Abat, Afat, Bsat Bbat, Bfat), what would be the syntax for that? Thanks again!
Why can't you just say where Order_Date+4&lt;Delivery_Date and Employee_ID=99999999 and month(Order_Date)=8; ?
That's what I want to know. What's determines if IF or WHERE is better. They process differently.
In what way do they process differently? I only use IF when I have to subset based on a condition created in the data step. For everything else I use WHERE.
Thank you! I rewatched the instruction 5 times and it still made no sense. You win the "I'm better than the pros" award today :)
Thank you for providing examples. 
Thanks. I suggest going over the SAS base certification prep guide book and take your time focusing on the PDV. You'll get the award next. :)
That's what I'm doing (I don't have the book, I'm doing the online e-learning moduals)
That makes sense. I follow your code logic. Does it matter the order of the keep, where, if, label statements? (I feel like I'm asking elementary questions, but it really is my attempt at master the concepts instead of just memorizing a form. I'd rather ask too many questions.) That chart with in the attached PDF was helpful! there is something comforting in knowing the "when" of use-- it's not just random, I just didn't want to find the patterns by a series of frustrating trial and error attempts
I think you can find an old PDF of the book online if you google it. 
That is the plan. My library actually has the e book
The reason not to include the function in the where statement is that the function will have to be called on every single read of the input line. So whilst it will mean that there are less 'total' lines read in, each read requires more processing. So for example, using "where Order_Date+4&lt;Delivery_Date and Employee_ID=99999999 and month(Order_Date)=8;" with 1 million records, and 1 record which matches all 3 will run the month(order_date) function 1 million times. Using "where Order_Date+4&lt;Delivery_Date and Employee_ID=99999999; if month(Order_Date)=8;" with the same data set, but 3 records that match the where clause, and only 1 that matches both the where and the if, the month function is only called 3 times. Which is more efficient is dependent on the data, and resources your system has available. Functions are usually quite cost efficient so it might indeed be better to include it in the where, however in an extreme example (like pulling 1 record from 10/15 million rows) it might be more noticeable.
Doesn't "Boolean short circuiting" take care of that, and prevent the evaluation of the third condition until the first two are met?
I believe SAS runs all the arguments in the where clause, and then determines whether to process it rather then going: is argument 1 met? Yes, ok argument 2. Is argument 2 met? No? Dismiss line, move onto next input line. However, as I said sas functions are very efficient, so you would have to have a HUGE number of observations (possibly hundreds of millions) and a minute number (sub 5) observations being returned from the first 2 arguments to notice the processing difference. Another possibility I suppose could be if they needed to create the Month(Date) variable for later analysis, so that could be why. At any rate, the difference between the two options is pretty negligible.
&gt; I believe SAS runs all the arguments in the where clause, and then determines whether to process it rather then going: is argument 1 met? Yes, ok argument 2. This seems to say that what you're saying is not true: http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi24/Begtutor/p72-24.pdf "For AND operators, order the conditions in ascending order of likelihood. Put the condition most likely to be false first, the condition second most likely to be false second, and so on."
I hadn't seen that before. I guess you are right. However, in the same paper it also mentions: "In subsequent releases, WHERE statements can perform less efficiently if they include SAS functions." That paper is from SUGI24 which I believe was 2000, so its quite a bit outdated. I doubt they would have removed boolean short circuiting, but am also curious as to why functions would be less efficient in where clauses... This could also be why the function was seperated from the where clause, if historically it was done for efficiency reasons which potentially are no longer around (and I cannot explain why this works, something you would have to ask SAS directly I guess).
In large datasets the WHERE clause is also much more efficient if you are selecting based on an indexed field. For example at my work we have a customer dataset with many millions of rows indexed on a customer ID, so if we are selecting a specific customer or small set of customers the WHERE clause runs practically instantaneously because the metadata knows which rows those IDs are in whereas the IF clause cycles through the entire dataset to find those values.
Do you need to rename the Number variable in each datasets before merging?
That is a great point I completely neglected. 
Well your data step looks fine, so is the problem the print? I don't know proc print syntax off the top of my head, and it may be valid, but I'd move the title statement outside of the proc for starters. Hopefully someone with more knowledge or a desktop with internet(on my phone) can chime in/look it up.
You're going to have to explain in more detail what you're trying to do and what the problem is. The title statement within the proc print shouldn't be causing any problems, but it's valid to place it before the proc print as it's a global statement.
No worries. Here are the instructions. I'm good with everything except #'s 3 &amp; 4. Thanks a lot! 1. Similar to handout #6, download two data sets from Announcement (jansales.dat and febsales.dat). Jansales.dat includes variables store_id, state, and jansales and febsales.dat includes variables store_id, state, and febsales. 2. Write a program to merge these two data sets by the store_id variable. 3. Use IN option such that observations showed in jansales.dat will appear. 4. Similarly, only observations showed in second data (febsales.dat) will appear. 5. In this program, also include using format, label, title and title2. 6.Hand in the output, log file, and the program.
Thanks. Should I have the title statement above the proc? I'm a beginner :)
Submit 'options msglevel=I;'. Sort the datasets by store_id variable. Merge the datasets. Use 'Proc print ; run;', check if the output is correct and your log. If there's a note/warnings/info in the merge statement in your log please resolve it. If everything is fine the problem is in your proc print syntax. Remove label after the data=jan_ Febsales in the proc print ?
It sounds like the assignment is asking you to output two datasets, 1 with the jansales observations and the other with the febsales observations. PROC SORT data=jansales; BY store_id;RUN; PROC SORT data=febsales; BY store_id;RUN; DATA janstores febstores; MERGE jansales (in=jan) febsales (in=feb); BY store_id; IF jan THEN OUTPUT janstores; IF feb THEN OUTPUT febstores; RUN; PROC PRINT... 
That's where I would put it. Title statements normally go in open code.
Not sure why you want to do that, but this is one way to drop a variable: DATA janstores (drop=jansales) febstores (drop=febsales); MERGE jansales (in=jan) febsales (in=feb); BY store_id; IF jan THEN OUTPUT janstores; IF feb THEN OUTPUT febstores; RUN; 
lol! I was thinking the same thing going through this! Anyways, thanks for taking the time to look at this.
I've tried a syntax highlighting plugin for Notepad++ a couple times, but it wasn't great and you could only write - not run. Some folks elsewhere in my company use UltraEdit and then call the SAS executable to run their programs in a non-interactive state, but I've never tried it/seen it in action.
&gt; call the SAS executable to run their programs in a non-interactive state What do you mean by that? Never heard of that before
Sounds like you're running SAS interactively from a desktop OS - where you write and submit your program and can see your log and output as the program executes. You can also run SAS non-interactively - or in batch mode - where your output and logs are directed to files on your system. Non-interactive SAS is extremely useful for long processing jobs (think many hours/days) or when you're working on mainframe system. By doing this, you can let SAS run in the background (without the UI) and go about doing other tasks while it crunches your data. The standard use of SAS at my company is hosted on a Linux machine where programmers interface via terminal alone. Even though we can use X-Windows to display the SAS UI interactively, many of the older programmers are very comfortable with writing programs in VI, pointing SAS to the code, and picking up their results from a file.
**For question 1 paired I used:** PROC TTEST DATA=DARWINPAIRED; PAIRED CROSS*SELF; TITLE 'Paired t-test'; RUN; **for unpaired I used:** PROC FREQ DATA = DARWINUNPAIRED; TABLES BREED * HEIGHT / NOPERCENT NOCOL CHISQ; RUN; PROC TTEST DATA=DARWINUNPAIRED; CLASS BREED; VAR HEIGHT; Title 'Independent Group t-Test'; RUN; 
Have you heard of SAS Enterprise Guide? 
I had a look at it. It's still single-window. It just looks like a more pointy-clicky GUI. I'm not the target demographic.

Yep, %SYSFUNC() around the mod. Here's an example I use often: * BENCHMARK! START; %LET BenchStartTime = %sysfunc(time(),12.); * whatever code here.; * BENCHMARK! REPORT; %PUT Execution time was %EVAL((%sysfunc(time(),12.) - &amp;BenchStartTime ) / 60) minutes %EVAL(%sysfunc(MOD(%sysfunc(time(),12.) - &amp;BenchStartTime ,60))) seconds; 
that's actually a pretty interesting piece of code. Thanks for the tip!
Just as an fyi, are you aware of proc print, where you can send the log directly to an external file and not need to clear the listing screen? If you need to be watching it or something, disregard, but it's quite useful for long logs.
I'd suggest using the built-in time formats and functions rather than resorting to `mod` to do that sort of calculation, e.g.: * BENCHMARK! START; %LET BenchStartTime = %sysfunc(time()); * whatever code here.; data _null_; call sleep(4,1); run; * BENCHMARK! END; %LET BenchEndTime = %sysfunc(time()); * BENCHMARK! REPORT; %put Execution time: %sysfunc(putn(&amp;BenchEndTime - &amp;BenchStartTime, time.)); For benchmarking individual procs and data steps, you can also use `option fullstimer;`
I use Emacs with ESS. Emacs has a steep learning curve, but once you learn it you'll never use anything else.
Yeah, SAS' UI (hell, all of their default graphics) = Hideous. I honestly don't know what their problem is. I use Sublime Text. It's not perfect, but it's the best I've found (I've used Notepad++ in the past and considered UltraEdit. I do not have the time to invest in learning emacs/VIM). There's a SAS syntax-highlight package available through here: http://implementing-vdw.blogspot.com/2012/10/new-sublime-text-package-available-for.html I think it had instructions on executing SAS code from Sublime Text--my employer's client's SAS security set-up doesn't allow such things, so I don't know whether it works. The Pardee SublimeText SAS syntax-highlighting package is fine if you're a more traditional SAS analyst (&gt;90% of your work is in datastep / PROCs). I spend most of my time in macro/PROC SQL, and have a modded-beyond-recognition (errr, most of that modding is undocumented...oops) version of that package that is combined with a customized version of the Solarized Light color theme (http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized ). If SublimeText looks promising, but the syntax-highlighting isn't sufficient for your needs, let me know--I'll try wrapping up my configuration and posting it to github.
What is in you .bat exactly. I've run into similar issues in win7 actually. 
The .cmd file looks something like this (all of the %parameters% are set correctly: ECHO ******* Start ******* call start "Test Script" /WAIT "%sasRoot%/sas" -emailsys smtp -emailhost "%emailhost%" -noovp -sysin "%appSourceRoot%/test_err.sas" -log "%startupLog%" -sysparm "|hostname=%COMPUTERNAME%" -errorabend -batch SET Capterr=%ERRORLEVEL% echo SAS Execution Complete with Exit code %Capterr% ECHO ******* End ******* The SAS script looks something like this: options errorabend; data work.a; set sashelp.prdsalesss; run; 
Ah, so I'm not the only one with an enterprise config like this, that's good to know. If you do manage to track down how your environment is set up for this, I'd love to hear what works for you. And I understand your concern about relying on a generic return code. But trust me when I say that the error-condition checking/shutdown is handled on the SAS side (I code for error conditions as if ANYTHING could go wrong, because I've literally seen a "data work.blah; set storelib.blah;run;" fail after working for months). However, the SAS job in question is an ETL job that runs between a new SQL Server DB and...an Access "database", where Access is the system of record. (cue grinding of teeth; I wasn't involved in the decision to pursue this "strategy", it got dumped in my lap after someone had written a buggy process). Anyway, my original goal was to have a scheduled task that would run a SAS macro that would check a client-provided log file on whether #%@#ing Access file had been updated yet for the morning, check the return-code from that macro, then do a "call start SAS..." if it had been updated. In the end, I "got" to learn enough DOS/CMD syntax to parse the log file in the cmd file itself...so, that was fun.
Really depends on your relationship with your manager. If you're good, a good manager will fight to keep you on as a remote employee. You should ask this in /r/cscareerquestions
Dates are the bane of data analysis. Doing the below is fine if the data is clean. The data is never clean. thisD = MDY(D_MO,D_DAY,D_YR); FORMAT thisD DATE9.;

It will say in the position info if telecommuting is allowed. The more travel time required the more likely they allow telecommuting.

I think it really depends on what industry you are in. In my last year of consulting, when I was not traveling (40% of the time) I was always working from home. Think I was in the office 8-10 times that year. And when I was traveling I was at the client office 100% of the time. My new position is in the banking industry, and we get one day a week (optional) to telecommute. They place a much larger emphasis on meeting in person and collaboration in person, although with my specific work (IMHO) I think I would only really need to be at work 1-2 days per week. Two things... one, US work culture in general has not hit critical mass yet when looking at telecommuting as a viable option. Most companies are doing it now to reduce real estate expenses AND because their competitors are doing it. If most managers could have it their way, they would still want there employees in the office for control. Two... companies still don't know how to handle HR telecommuting issues when they come up. I have witnessed so many firms that, instead of writing up or firing an employee that abuses telecommuting (ie not doing work), they stop the telecommuting program entirely. Firms that are smart are employing telecommuting because it reduces the real estate costs, they have business controls in place to make sure their employees work is performance based (projects, sales, chargeable hours), and they have "effective" HR controls in place to deal with employees abusing telecommuting policy. Off the soapbox now and back to analytics work @ the office ;)
you should come up with them because you know her, but it is a nice thought.
On the very bottom of the mug, you should draw the running man. 
I'm also looking for something else. Ideally, I'd like to keep the Log, Results Viewer, and Explorer like they are and have the ability to break the Enhanced Editor out into a separate window. Place each on a separate monitor.
SAS has log function, did you try google? 
NewVariable=log(oldvariable);
Math. Log`x` Y = Log Y / Log X myLogVal = LOG(myVar) / LOG(myBase);
Yeah that's exactly what my professor told me. I tried it, and it didn't help. He looked over my sas file and he even said he can't find anything in the actual code that would be doing this. So at this point I've been trying to fix that one thing for a few days now, off and on, and I'm just getting tired of trying to fix it. I really have no clue why it would be doing this. I've tried many different things to try to get around it... (edit) It's finally fixed. Thank god, heh.
Ah thank you, this worked, finally. So far this makes my first impressions of SAS as frustrating, but I'm betting when I actually learn more I'll be able to fix these little hiccups that pop up. I spent far too much time trying to fix this one little thing, heh.
Sounds about right. Now, for a larger helping of frustration, try: * Doing the same thing again using the excel libname engine * Doing the same thing again using DDE * Hard mode: Importing non-delimited data from a text file with multiple lines per record using an input statement...
Come on, man.... If pissed to the sub before looki NG into it themselves, this sub would really stink... :)
Create a new data set. PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE newData AS SELECT * FROM oldData WHERE Name || Queue IN (SELECT Name || Queue FROM oldData GROUP BY Name || Queue HAVING Count(*) &gt; 2); QUIT;
Thank you! I didn't realize merge can do one to many matching
Using SQL in SAS is not something I'm entirely familiar with. Is a merge step more efficient?
No problem! Make sure to sort first. And remember merge can not do many to many.
proc sql; create table new as select a.*, b.* from ds1 as a inner join ds2 as b on a.BASEID = b.BASEID order by BASEID; quit;
It should say a. *, b. * &lt;--the asterisk doesn't show up for whatever reason.
The SQL solutions posted by others are the most straight forward way. However, here's a solution without using SQL: *sort limiting BASEID from ds1; *output a new database called ds_r; *only keep the variable BASEID; *remove duplicate values of BASEID; Proc Sort data=DS1 out=DS1_R (keep=BASEID) nodupkey; By BASEID; Run; *merge ds1_r dataset with ds2 only when BASEID from ds1_r; Data New; Merge ds1_r (in=a) ds2 (in=b); By BASEID; If a; run;
Also note that MERGE will not warn you when you attempt many to many, and the output might look OK, but it really isn't. 
For one thing, if you are sorting on ID you will be killing any indexing that may have been done on other columns. Really depends on your data size and shape how much impact one way vs the other will have. SQL is much more readable IMO, especially when you get the steps broken out on to separate lines and use joins vs subqueries like Begerbeger does, but that is personal preference. 
Data new; Merge dat1(in=a) dat2(in=b); By Id; If a; Run;
You won't get a warning but you can search your log for "repeats of by variables". If you have that message then you have a many to many merge. 
So, I was a little frustrated earlier. Some of the problem is invalid views in our database. So that is our fault but does it not have a timeout property? I have to kill it if it hits one. Another issue, is that if there are many tables it will reach the last one, write the metadata, and continue spinning. I have to kill it. The metadata is fine. Strange. Sorry for my sorta rant.

SQL is extremely intuitive and would be a great tool to have in your toolbox going forward using SAS. I would highly recommend taking a look at it. If you want any recommendations let me know and I'll see what I can find. 
To print it on each report : title "Report Title" ; proc report ... ; run ; proc report ... ; run ; /* etc */ title ; To print it on the first report only : title "Report Title" ; proc report ... ; run ; title ; /* disable titles */ proc report ... ; run ; 
What do your class notes say?
Your data has the variables Country year obligations Which you have converted to Country decade year obligations Decade takes the value 1960 when year is between 1960 and 1969. Do proc means on this data: Proc means data=mydata; By country decade; Var obligations; Output out=mydatasum sum=sumoblig; This will give you the dataset mydatasum which has variables Country decade sumoblig Then do a transpose: Proc transpose data=mydatasum out=mydatasum prefix=d; By country; Var sumoblig; Id decade; This should create a dataset with Country d1960 d1970 d1980 Etc. 
There may be some trick in the input statement. But you could always take the current input and paste all lines together. Like next untested code? data longstring; length myline $ 10000; set manystring; by oldline unsorted; retain myline; if _n_=1 then myline=oldline; else myline=strip(myline) || oldline; keep myline; if last.oldline then output; run;
Thank you for your help. I'm running into an issue where the final data set has one of the decades in the wrong place (ie 1970 1980 2000 2010 1990). For some reason your code worked perfectly for a subset of the dataset, but not for a different subset. 
to give context, my end goal is to have a program that reads in all sas programs in a given folder, and outputs the filepaths of all files that were read in with a SAS program. 
If your problem is that the final dataset comes out looking like this: Country d1960 d1970 d1980 d2000 d2010 d1990 then do this: after running everything, do a final data step to reorder the variables: data mydatasum; retain Country d1960 d1970 d1980 d1990 d2000 d2010; set mydatasum; run; 
That's potentially a bit more manageable, provided that where you read in files you've hard-coded the paths. If you're reading in files whose paths have been constructed from macro variables or wildcards then it will be harder to match all of them. You will also need to distinguish between files that are being read from and files that are being written to. Unless you have a truly vast amount of code to work through, it may be easier to do this manually. 
Yeah, I'll have to think of a clever way to deal with that. That's partially why I wanted to read the programs into one variable per program as opposed to one variable per line. 
In some cases there may be no obvious way of making the distinction - e.g. you can run a filename statement and then use the assigned filename for both reading *and* writing, possibly over the course of multiple data steps or %included programs. This seems like a problem that would be better solved with mandatory coding standards - e.g. by requiring authors to maintain a list of pertinent files in comments at the top of each program. Or if you're using SAS 9.2 or later, you can use [SAS DI studio](http://support.sas.com/software/products/etls/) to keep track of this sort of thing.
That worked great, thank you! Last question, if you're still around. If I wanted to merge datasets together only if the variable was in both datasets, what should I do? 
Yes, I think I misspoke, I meant variables. I merged two data sets initially; this yielded (Data3)something similar to: Country 1960sE 1970sE 1980sE 1960sD 1970sD 1980sD. I am now merging Data3 with Data4. Data4 lookins something like: Country 1960sF 1970sF 1980sF There are "missing" countries in Data4 (IE Afghanistan is missing in Data4 but it is present in Data3). I want my new, merged data set to only show data that was present in both datasets. My previous post had that code in there which I think works. Now I need another data set that shows the countries that did not match between Data3 and Data4, and vice versa. 
You're confusing me. Let me define some terms. A variable is "Country", or "1960sE". An observation is "Afghanistan:600000:600000:9000000:200000" (i.e., a "row" of data). It seems that what you want is to keep observations which are present in Data3 and Data4. Is this right?
Sorry, been up for a while. I want to keep observations only if the observation for the variable "Country" is present in both datasets. IE: Afghanistan is present in Data3 but not in Data4. I want to delete this row, and everything in it. I think I got it to work through this code: DATA MatchFail; SET AlmostFinal; *Merged Data3 and Data4; IF Avg_Life_Exp_60s = '.' then delete; RUN; Countries present in Data4 that were not present in Data3 would not have Avg_Life_Exp values. I figured if I just told SAS any time 60s = '.' then it would delete the row and I think it did. 
Your earlier code won't work. &gt; DATA FinalData; Merge Data1 Data2; BY Country; IF cmiss(of all) then delete; RUN; Suppose Data1 has a row like: Afghanistan:60000:20000:10000 And Data2 has a row like: Afghanistan::30000:90000 (Notice that the second variable is missing in Data2). Then when you do the merge with your code, it will merge this observations sucessfully, but delete it because cmiss(of \_all\_) will return a value of 1 (the one original missing observation). To do what you want, you need to use the code I posted: data both; merge dataOne(in=a) dataTwo(in=b); by country date; if a and b; run; What this does is that it merges both, but it creates two temporary variables a and b. a is 1 if the observation in the merged dataset is present in DataOne, b is 1 if it was in dataTwo. You want to keep observations from both, so keep observations with both a=1 and b=1, or if a and b; &gt; DATA MatchFail; SET AlmostFinal; *Merged Data3 and Data4; IF Country = ' ' then Delete; IF Avg_Life_Exp_60s = '.' then delete; RUN; I'm not sure what you're trying to do here. How can there be a missing "country" in the almostfinal dataset?
Could you let me know how to write the code in its format in reddit? That way my code can come across a little cleaner as well. And I think I need to backtrack a little because I've confused myself (oops). The last code I had was in result of backtracking from an erroneous dataset if I'm understanding this better now. I've redone the code to merge my datasets incorporating the in= options. At this point, I think I have all the variables that are present in both datasets showing. (In turn meaning any variables that were present in Data 1 but not Data 2 and vice versa are not shown). From here, I need to create a data set which contains country names from Data1 that did not match a country name in Data2, and viceversa. 
To get a code indentation, leave a blank line and then put four spaces at the start of the next line before you start typing the program. To get those that were in one and not two, just do: data inOneNotTwo; merge dataOne(in=a) dataTwo(in=b); by country date; if a and not(b); run; Because b tells you if the observation was in dataTwo or not. Edit: you don't have a date variable, so it'll just be By country; 
Awesome, that worked perfectly (I think!). The final part of this is some basic data reading. I read in my data file, which contains data in the following format: Country Program Amount Year Afghanistan Military Aid 2,000,000 1985 Afghanistan Humanitarian Aid 4,000,000 1940 Afghanistan Education Funds 20,000,000 1945 Algeria Military Aid 20,000,000 1946 Algeria Infrastructure 21,000,000 1990 I need to find two things: 1) the number of unique programs since 1946, which I think I need to use a nodupkey step for I already had this part done, but I lost my .sas file. I think I used nlevels, but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do that. and 2) print 2 tables, the first of which is the 10 nations that have the most number of different programs and the second of which is a table showing the 3 nations that received the most total funding. EDIT: This is my code for 1: DATA = DATA1; SET DATA; if (1946 &lt; Year) then delete; RUN; PROC FREQ DATA = Data1 nlevels; tables program; TITLE 'Number of Distinct Programs'; RUN; 
Do I understand this correctly: You want to specify a path (i.e. C:\PROGRAMS) and have it recursively locate all SAS files under that path and put them into a variable with the full path?
Side note - the variable created via `filename=` in the infile statement will be automatically dropped at the end of your data step, so if you need to save the file name, you have to create another variable as a copy of it.
Also specify the length of both variables before you create them to ensure you don't get truncated filenames
What is the purpose of putting the contents of the SAS program into a variable, as opposed to just running an %inc on the path?
It's not about running code, it's about analyzing the contents of the SAS program to determine what it does
I think you mean dirlist in your infile
Are the DEV versions just newer? I deal with writing and updating macros for my work place and we have this problem where 60 programmers can't learn to use a different macro call for their programs all at once. Your solution is a good one that let's us just bypass them and force them to use the latest versions, if I understood you correctly....
Yes I did, and I found no intelligble results to this rather simple question. I found it now though, thanks!
It's probably just ended up that way as the language has evolved over the past few decades, and changing it now would cause all sorts of interesting bugs in people's legacy code. Given that the main reason institutions still pay $$$ for SAS is because they have large legacy codebases that they don't want to translate to another language, I would imagine that SAS Institute tends to err on the side of caution.
This might help... data times; length raw_time $5 time_num 8 time_hour 8 ; infile datalines; input raw_time ; time_num = input(raw_time,time5.); time_hour = time_num /3600 ; datalines; 00:00 00:02 01:30 12:30 16:50 23:21 ; time_num is the number of seconds since midnight. (this is how SAS works with time) time_hour is then the above but in hour format. Not really sure if I understood the question. If you want more help, please just let me know. 
Arh OK. Sorry if you already know this, but its similar. Dates are expressed in the number of days since 01JAN1960. Datetimes are expressed in the number of seconds since midnight 01JAN1960. Code below will show this. data dates_and_datetimes; length raw_date $9 raw_datetime $18 date datetime 8 ; infile datalines dlm=','; input raw_date raw_datetime ; date = input(raw_date,date9.); datetime = input(raw_datetime,datetime18.); datalines; 01JAN1960,01JAN1960:00:00:00 02JAN1960,01JAN1960:00:00:12 01JAN1940,01JAN1940:23:20:00 05NOV2014,05NOV2014:09:06:54 ;
Hi, Some links to get you started: http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html SAS University Edition (free download). [SAS e-Learning courses](https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us&amp;productType=library) (only 2 are free though). Also, if you're into books, I can highly recommend "The little SAS book" and "SAS for Dummies" as good started books into the world of SAS. You can probably find them in a library, but they're also available for purchase as ebooks: [SAS for Dummies](http://www.amazon.com/SAS-For-Dummies-Stephen-McDaniel/dp/0470539682) and [The Little SAS Book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-SAS-Book-Edition-ebook/dp/B00B29H9HU) Many universities have SAS courses available on-line as well. Here are a few examples: [UCLA](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/) [UTK](http://web.utk.edu/sas/OnlineTutor/1.2/en/60476/index.htm)
Awesome, thanks for your help.
SAS for dummies was useless. Figure what you want to do, then Google solutions.
Yes it is a pointy clicky GUI but you can also just write straight SAS code in enterprise Guide... http://www.lexjansen.com/wuss/2013/83_Paper.pdf 
[This article provides everything you need to know in great detail.](http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi29/265-29.pdf)
You can apply a FORMAT (e.g. [Picture format](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat480/node/79)) to make the phone numbers uniform, then do an if/then function to find just the numbers that are in incorrect format. This may be a really simplistic answer to a more complex problem. Do you have a list of out-dated numbers to compare?
Another vote for the Little SAS book. There are tons of resources online with all of the user group conference papers posted. The biggest problem you will have is figuring out what it is you're trying to do. Once you do that you should be able to locate specific resources. If I were learning it over again I would focus on a few things at the beginning: 1. Control and understand your formatting - dates specifically 2. Proc SQL - very useful in shaping data And I know people say not to get into macros until later but debugging them has always been helpful for me in learning. Oh - and take advantage of the sAS help datasets once you get them. Saves you time of finding data to look at. 
Damn, after a few days trying to install it I finally find the University edition wont run on my laptop as it doesn't have virtualisation possible on the processor. Bit disappointing the free version is so finnicky and unfriendly to install after coming from Tableau where it takes 5 mins and just works. Il just have to stick with the guides and vids in the meantime. 
Do you mean the processor on your laptop itself doesn't allow for virtualization? You may want to check the [SAS University Edition Help Center](http://support.sas.com/software/products/university-edition/faq/main.htm) or consult the [SAS Analytics U Community](http://2.sas.us/AnalyticsUComm) for a workaround. Good luck! UPDATE: And, of course, [SAS Tech Support](http://2.sas.com/TechSupport) could help too.
I went with a combination of Perl regular expressions and the COMPRESS function. Edit: Typo. data test; infile datalines; input; instr=_infile_; length instr outstr $20; *capture only a sequence of digits, dashes and spaces at the end of the string; outstr=prxchange('s/^.*[^\d]?(\d{3,4}[ -]?\d{3,4})$/$1/',1,strip(instr)); outstr=compress(outstr,,'dk'); *remove all but digits; datalines; 303-315-2799 942 3303954 (720) 447-0999 215 954-6607 724-4633 ; run;
You could try SAS OnDemand for Academics, which does not require a download or virtual machine. See this page under “Independent Learner” as it has the steps to access SODA: http://support.sas.com/software/products/ondemand-academics/#s1=2
Does it need to export as spss dataset or is .csv OK? 
Thanks, I'll play with this idea. 
Hoping to Gods this isn't PHI..
What are regular expressions? I've never learned that.
Ive never learned prxparse before. can you explain or direct me to the correct place?
Ill look into that thanks!
Thats a little too complex for me. I've never learned any of the functions between input and datalines lol.
whats PHI?
A picture format wouldn't help with the reading-in step. To read text into a numeric variable, you need to use an *informat*, and there's no picture equivalent for those.
Here's some code: data all; length phone_num $ 15; phone_num='212-646-6718'; output; phone_num='(212) 646-6718'; output; phone_num='2126466718'; output; phone_num='646 6718'; output; run; data all; IF _N_ = 1 THEN PATTERN_NUM = PRXPARSE("/(\d{3}[\s\-]?\d{3}[\s\-]?\d{4}|\(\d{3}\)[\s\-]?\d{3}[\s\-]?\d{4})/"); RETAIN PATTERN_NUM; set all; POSITION = PRXMATCH(PATTERN_NUM,phone_num); run; proc print; run; PRXPARSE accepts a regular expression for parsing. You can refer to the regex by pattern_num. PRXMATCH searches a string (in this case, phone_num) for the regex in pattern_num, and returns the position found (0 if not found). Running the code above produces position = 1 for all entries except the last, as expected. You can read about the PRX functions here: http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi29/265-29.pdf 
[protected health information](http://www.hipaa.com/2009/09/hipaa-protected-health-information-what-does-phi-include/)
[These things.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) They're essentially a way of defining a pattern, which you then feed into a function along with some data so that it can identify/extract/alter the parts of the data that match the pattern.
Nice!
Wow that looks complicated. I need to read more into this. Ill let you know thanks for the reference 
&gt; POSITION = PRXMATCH(PATTERN_NUM,phone_num); Can you explain the purpose of this line and what it does? 
You can export a separate dataset of format values using the cntlout option: proc format library = proclib cntlout=formats_dataset; run; Then you can export your formats to a csv or some other format for reference, the same way you would export any other dataset.
Thanks that works and looks like just what I need. Iv been watching some videos and I get the idea but it will be nice to play around a bit myself too.
Sounds do-able - post some dummy data on pastebin or similar and I'm sure someone can advise.
Post the code
Principal component or univariate analysis are a couple of methods you should look into using. 
the data are in the order in which they took place, however, there is no timestamp on any data points. No participants are missing sessions. every participant took 8 sessions of the task. the cumbersome part of this data is that each participant's data is stored in a seperate CSV file and that each session consists of a varying number of trials. 
did you try a slash before localhost? infile "/localhost/Users/...
Something like: PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE ext_scripts AS SELECT ds2.*, ds1.startdt, ds1.enddt FROM ds2 LEFT JOIN ds1 ON ds2.id=ds1.id WHERE filldt &lt; startdt OR filldt &gt; enddt; QUIT;
Does your problem explicitly state that you have to use `union` and `corr`? That seems like a very strange way of approaching this problem. It would be simpler to join the two tables on ID and then filter out the dates you don't want with a `where` clause. Also, please post your example data as text (ideally as a functional data step).
Are you in the correct working folder?
Homework help is fine, as long as it's asking for guidance and not the answer. As for the active part, anyone can post...
Ok
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the idea of clustering on a variable, say unit, means that you allow for arbitrary correlation of errors within a unit, but have zero correlation of errors across units. If each resident belongs to at most one unit, then clustering by resident and by unit is redundant: clustering by unit allows arbitrary correlation between any two observations within units, and therefore between any two observations for one resident (or indeed any two observations for two different residents belonging to the same unit).
* 57k * 6 months of professional experience (used SAS for 1 academic year in my master of public health degree) * 10 days pto (for years 0-4, 15 for years 5-20) I am very fortunate to work at a place with a lot of well written legacy code to learn from, but I would say I am a sub par programmer.
A simple initial approach here would be to fit your model on a randomly chosen 80% of your data and validate it on the remaining 20% (i.e. using the 20% as a hold-out sample). If that still isn't enough, and you've automated the fitting process, you might as well generalise this all the way to [k-fold cross-validation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_\(statistics\)#k-fold_cross-validation).
Something like: PROC SURVEYSELECT DATA=mySourceData OUT=mySampleData METHOD=URS REPS=10 OUTHITS SEED=3588941 SAMPSIZE=250; RUN;
The one recommendation I would make to you, is start a template library. Any time you write something worth while, macros mostly, write a generic version and print it out. Mine mostly take one page, but some are longer. I keep mine in a binder. I tried a couple places to keep them on line, but too many sites are blocked by too many clients/employers.
Yes I was going to break up the data as a last resort and I suppose 200 is still decent sized.. I forgot about k-fold. Thanks
Actually I used bootstrapping to help choose my model but I didn't think about using it to measure classification rates. Why didn't I think of that haha
Pharma or finance?
Any chance you'd sell your library or offer them somehow? What about using Google docs? 
I used SAS as part of my MPH program as well, but I never felt comfortable/confident enough to apply to jobs for it. How much of what you learned do you actually use at your job? Also, what's your title if you don't mind sharing? Thanks!
What's a binder? 
84k, 15% bonus
Thank you very much for your response. Basically, I have multiple assessments per resident, and multiple residents per unit, and I am trying to construct a model which deals with the covariance "correctly". I also have unbalanced data.
I have 28 variables with 378 observations. So in looking at the DATA step that PROC IMPORT creates, I tried to do what you suggested but for some reason this returns makes every observation a missing value for that specific variable. I'm still fiddling with it and if I get it to work, I'll let you know!
Could try reading into MS Excel then back out again. You might also consider trying exporting from excel using "TEXT (MS-DOS)" if CSV gives you headaches.
It' just weird because I have three other variables that do the same thing, but those are read in just fine. I don't know why this particular variable is confusing SAS. edit: I totally just figured it out. Thanks for your help!
What I want to know is whether a resident could belong to multiple units.
unfortunately my library has a lot of things I don't own. I have permission to have it, but not to share it.
Thanks! 
70k + 20% bonus potential 5 years of experience 6% 401k Match 6% Pension (no cost to me) Flex time for working on my masters 24 days of PTO 11 holidays I had no prior SAS experience before taking this job, I do have a comp sci degree and my prior experience was in building systems.

I just don't think I would remember to do it all on my own now. Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head. We never used proc sql so I don't know what that is. 
In my experience, this is your best bet. Get rid of the extra commas in Excel and export it. Also, if it's possible, ask the person that created it to do it again with a different delimiter (| or ;) since they're the ones that screwed this up. 
How much is the total pay after adding all of the % s. Is it 90k?
Same with 5yrs experience in Pharma. 
Somewhere around there. 
Don't be an idiot. I can promise you that a pirated copy will not work. Get a legit copy for free. Install it properly. http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html
SAS now offers a "university edition" which is completely free. Use that.
Could you not use a random or repeated statement for that?
It would help to know how many hours, and how much you're paying.
The university edition does have a few limitations. You have to run a SAS server (limited to 2 CPU cores) inside a (locked-down) VM, and then access it using a web browser. You get the following SAS modules: * Base SAS Software * SAS/STAT * SAS/IML * SAS/Secure 168-bit * SAS/ACCESS Interface to PC Files * SAS/ACCESS Interface to ODBC * SAS/IML Studio * SAS Workspace Server for Local Access * SAS Workspace Server for Enterprise Access * High Performance Suite
Not sure how long it would take. 25$ an hour maybe
Forget the procs for a sec... Do you know what you'd need to do, and more importantly, why you need to do it? 
yea, for the most part. when I don't, there's [this](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/whatstat/default.htm)
It isn't clear what you mean by 'jumbled' - it would help if you posted some images of the plots and the code you've tried so far (as text please). Bear in mind that `proc gplot` plots your dataset verbatim, in the order read. Try sorting your data by visit before plotting and see if that helps.
The repeated statement works for multiple assessments per patient, but PROC GENMOD doesn't have a random statement. Because it's not a linear model, I can't use PROC MIXED (which has both a repeated and a random statement).
No, a resident cannot belong to multiple units. So clustering on facility/unit is more or less conservative (i.e. smaller/larger standard errors) than clustering on patient?
Date fixed effects are not enough to take care of serial correlation. Clustered standard errors, however, are enough, because they allow arbitrary correlation within the cluster I.e., also across dates for a particular individual.
What about proc glimmix? It doesn't have the repeated but you can use it by doing random _ residual _ on a separate line 
Create a variable patient_dose ('Patient 1 Dose 1', 'Patient 1 Dose 2',...) and use that as the plotting character after the equals sign
sorry, that wasn't clear -- what i mean by jumbled is that the subjects data points are no longer connected when I use interpol=join on the symbols statement. in other words all the points within a dose are connected together. I left off that interpolation between the points was being used, sorry about that. not sure what you mean paste by text but I put a [drawing of what I'm after here](http://imgur.com/JThLGdz)
But it is assuming the same correlation between patients in a unit/facility, and repeated measurements for a patient, right? Would date fixed effects + clustered standard errors be sufficient to describe the model? I get a slightly better model fit using date fixed effects, though the estimates/directions/significances etc. are almost the exact same between the two models. It just seems to make the most sense to have a time component in the model, somehow.
I thought about using GLIMMIX. I didn't know you could use random on the residual. Thanks! I'll look into that.
incidentally I got around this by using R, but still want to know how this could be done in SAS as it's not always convenient to go between the two. ggplot(myData, aes(x=factor(visit), y=labres, group=dose, color=dose)) + geom_point(size=4) + geom_line(aes(group=factor(Subject)))
&gt; But it is assuming the same correlation between patients in a unit/facility, This is not true. Within a cluster, the error terms can be arbitrarily correlated with each other. I would include a date fixed effect, and it doesn't seem to change your conclusions, so the point is somewhat moot. I don't know what your model is, but if you're measuring any sort of change (e.g., does patient health improve over stay?) then the date fixed effects you're talking about (e.g. 3 months from initial assessment, 4 months, etc.) are obviously wrong. But it may be that you're not looking at changes. 
Okay, thanks for the clarification. I am not modeling change; I am modeling incidence of falls/transfers over a period of time in nursing homes using as predictors resident-level and facility-level fixed effects.
Do you have the same number of patients for each dose? With GPLOT, you can use the SYMBOL statement with an R= option to repeat the color/value/whatever options x times. I don't think that the SYMBOL statements do anything with the SGPLOT procedure. I'll poke around and see if I can figure out how to get SGPLOT to respect both pt and dose as group variables. I don't know off the top of my head.
I'm still not 100% sure this is exactly what you're after, and I don't know if there's a more elegant way that uses some option that I'm not aware of, but here's a GPLOT way and an SGPLOT way: data a; do patient = "PAT 1", "PAT 2", "PAT 3"; do dose = 1 to 3; do t = 10 to 30 by 10; y= 10*dose + t/10 + 40*ranuni(8675309); pd=patient||dose; dp=dose||patient; output; end; end; end; run; proc sql; create table attr as select distinct pd as value , "PD" as id , dose , "black" as fillcolor from a; quit; data attr; set attr; if dose=1 then linecolor="green"; if dose=2 then linecolor="red "; if dose=3 then linecolor="blue "; drop dose; run; title "SGPLOT with an 'attribute map'"; proc sgplot data=a dattrmap=ATTR; series x=t y=y/ group=pd attrid=PD; run; title "GPLOT with SYMBOL statments and R="; symbol1 i=join v=none color=blue r=3; symbol2 i=join v=none color=red r=3; symbol3 i=join v=none color=black r=3; proc gplot data=a; plot y*t=dp; run;
Looks like the STYLEATTRS statement is the deal. You can have colors, line patterns, or even both change. I concatenated patient ID and dose to get the GROUP= variable, and then put a color for each dose (and a line pattern for each patient, but that's just me...) result: http://imgur.com/dwUTjeG. I'm calling it a night, and this is a throwaway because I never reddit on my work computer where I have SAS installed. I'll try and remember to look at this thread again to see if this was close to what you wanted. title "SGPLOT with DATACOLORS="; proc sgplot data=a nocycleattrs; styleattrs datacontrastcolors=(RED BLUE GREEN) datalinepatterns=(dot solid longdash); series x=t y=y/ group=pd ; run;
Look into proc template and ods graphics. You can control a lot of things with proc template. 
Thanks for your time! This indeed retains the connection between subject, and allows me to color based on dose. Intuitively I wouldn't think to create a subject-dose combined variable, because then I just have num subjects * num doses groups now, but I'm not going to over-think it, it works. The only little niggle that I have is doses could vary, so I would rather not supply colors up front, but that could still be programmed. Thank you for the sgplot rundown! you let me know your non-throwaway and you're gilded ;-) 
Try turning ODS graphics off and then run the code as you have it. 
$93k with 9 years experience. When I started in entry level, it was $42k. Flexible schedule and ability to work from home are two great benefits that my team is given compared to other teams - even other business intelligence teams -within the company. 
Dumb teacher because we never used SAS... We were using R... And today he decided to introduce us to SAS with no documentation whatsoever. So yeah, he's retarded.
http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/ormpug/59679/HTML/default/viewer.htm#nlp_sect50.htm
Thanks, this is what I needed. 
I figured it out I just needed to change my model and use the repeated measure function: title 'mixed design'; data a; input choice article pre post delta; datalines; 1 1 4 6 2 1 1 3 8 5 1 1 5 9 4 1 2 6 8 2 1 2 6 9 3 1 2 7 10 3 1 3 5 8 3 1 3 4 8 4 1 3 8 10 2 1 3 5 8 3 1 3 6 9 3 2 1 8 9 1 2 1 7 8 1 2 1 7 9 2 2 1 8 10 2 2 2 3 7 4 2 2 8 10 2 2 2 8 10 2 2 3 8 9 1 2 3 7 9 2 2 3 5 8 3 ; proc glm; class choice; model pre post=choice /nouni; repeated subknowl 2; run; 
You could try using the excel option in a libname statement, and then try using the dictionary.tables set to pull a substring of the variable names...That's if the libname statement works. If it doesn't, I'd save the excel file as a CSV, and use manual input statements reading from that file.
Yo, analyst here. Base SAS Programmer Certification is valuable and useful for industry standard work, especially actuarial. It took me around 2 months to prep for the exam. It is not the most difficult thing ever, but still needs some consistent effort, might take a little longer if you are doing it along with school or work. I'd also like to mention that the value of my resume didn't shoot up as much as I'd expected it to after the Base SAS, but certainly did after the Advanced SAS certification. My suggestion to you is to follow through with that one too, that is if you are still interested in the analytical industry. Advanced SAS on the other hand is much harder relatively, but you should be fine if you have a few years of SAS exp. under your belt. 
You're in the right track, but you will actually want the mean of the death variable. Class would be the groups you are looking to compare, like treated vs untreated or male vs female. proc means mean std n data=data; class treatment; var death; run;
I've done the Base Sas exam and the advanced qualification. There was a lot of emphasis on reading in external files and identifying correct syntax in multiple choice form rather than any test of your skills. If you've never used Sas before should only take a few hours a week for a few months to pass it. There are plenty of past papers if you look around to get the general idea. Sas will try and charge you for them but it's not worth it. The advanced certification had an emphasis on proc sql efficiency techniques. I found them both to be a bit of a tick in a box type qualification rather than teach you anything important like how to solve real world problems. This was a few years ago and was in the UK for what it's worth. 
Are you trying to create a new data set with only patients that are dead? If so then try: data DeadPatients; set OldDataSet; if Death=1; This code creates a new data set that only contains patients that are dead. 
proc freq data=patients nlevels; run; This will return the frequency each of 0 and 1, with a percentage of the whole calculation. As to how to pull them out from proc means in a datastep: proc means data=patients n; class death; output out=deathrate; run;
What resources did you find most valuable for studying? 
This book is decent, much cheaper than prep books published by the SAS Institute (~$30 on amazon): http://books.google.com/books/about/SAS_Certified_Base_Programmer_for_SAS_9.html?id=0fnaAgAAQBAJ
Thanks!
Use the Excel LIBNAME engine to read it in. The columns will be renamed to SAS variable names you probably will not like but the original column names will be preserved in the SAS variable labels...which you can then use to rename them. Another simple solution is to edit the Excel spreadsheet to change the names.
The little blue SAS book to start with. Then lots of past papers. I feel like I'm giving you a cop out answer when I say Google 'Base sas past papers'. If you do this you'll pass. You will probably find when you have a few years experience that you didn't really learn a huge amount that you go on to use. Some of the rudimentary stuff maybe but some of the reading from external files content I never used again. And I've been using Base SAS for 10 years. Good luck! But from what you've said you'll be fine. 
What are you really trying to do?
Maximum Likelihood on a negative binomial (2 parameters) with r=2 to find the p 
The Little SAS Book: A Primer is always solid.
It has been my bible all semester!
It's not a SAS bug, and it's not really a bug. It's a problem that all computers have - they cannot represent numbers precisely. Here's some blurb from SAS: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/67885/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0ji1unv6thm0dn1gp4t01a1u0g6.htm You get the same problem in R, but R has a function called all.equal() which tries to solve it: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-doesn_0027t-R-think-these-numbers-are-equal_003f 
Yea, you're right. I guess my point was that 99% of the stuff you find online isn't going to work, especially if you don't know what you're doing. And while the University Edition isn't the greatest, at least you know that your license won't suddenly expire on you or a update to the system breaks your crack and you're stuck without a working copy when you need it most. Not worth it IMO. 
You could try using a ROUND function to compensate. This [paper](http://analytics.ncsu.edu/sesug/2008/PO-082.pdf) has some other suggestions as well.
That though occurred to me after I wrote that - if you can't figure your way around software licenses, how are you going to debug your SAS code!
Not hard at all. In a month or so, I was proficient.
but, do u need to be a statistican to make the most of SAS? what kind of things do u use it for? My company is letting me get a license for it, but just want to make sure i'm not in over my head. 
Alternatively, your company could buy a different implementation here: http://www.teamwpc.co.uk/ ... and probably have enough in the budget to buy one for every member of your team
True. You can also buy wpc from a wholesale reseller. The only potentials downside is lack of support and zeros click and point programming. 
It should be pretty easy to make the jump. If you need access to SAS's online self-paced classes I can give you a code that would allow you to access all of the following for free: SAS Enterprise Guide 1: Querying and Reporting (EG4.3) SAS Programming Introduction: Basic Concepts SAS Programming 1: Essentials SAS Programming 2: Data Manipulation Techniques SAS SQL 1: Essentials SAS Programming 3: Advanced Techniques and Efficiencies SAS Macro Language 1: Essentials SAS Enterprise Guide 1: Querying and Reporting (EG4.2) Statistics 1: Introduction to ANOVA, Regression, and Logistic Regression SAS Enterprise Guide: ANOVA, Regression, and Logistic Regression Querying, Reporting, and Analysing Data Using SAS Enterprise Guide Send me a PM if interested. 
Interesting. I've just finished evaluating it and their support (I communicated with them directly, not via reseller) was sensational. There is, indeed, no sort of 'point and click' programming interface though, you have to write code.
True. It suits my needs though since the bulk of what I do deals with data manipulation. Mind if I ask what you'd be looking to use wpc for?
It should be easy for you to learn. Its different from other programming languages in that you don't have to understand or even be aware of OOP I bet even when you learn it, you'll find yourself using SQL (proc SQL) to do a lot of your data cleaning / merging etc. The SAS e-learnings are pretty good to learn or review some basic statistical concepts too 
The compelling reason to use SAS is if you have to work with large datasets, larger than would fit in memory. My work routinely uses datasets &gt; 5GB, and my computer only has 3 GB memory, so...
There are [various packages](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11055502/recommended-package-for-very-large-dataset-processing-and-machine-learning-in-r) you can use to get around that issue - what has your experience been?
Thanks, the reason I want to use SAS is because I wanted to analyze customer churn. we have a huge datawarehouse that I can connect to and do the analysis. I guess I could use R, but i'm not a stats person and SAS just seems easier. My analysis is not going to be too technical. I was going to do some logistics regression on customer churn. 
I tried using R/SQL, but didn't get performance anywhere near SAS'. I have not tried ff and bigmemory.
you can try both solutions. Download SAS University edition and R and try them both.
The SAS language is easy to learn and you can do a lot with such a small amount of code. I find newbies doing a lot of things the hard way but there's typically already a PROC for that. 
I can debug my SAS code well enough, but is still my first coding program. I just got started on HTML &amp; CSS if that's any indication of my amateurism
I'm sure you'll do just fine with SAS. I think most people who use analytics software are not programmers, but it takes problem-solving and troubleshooting. I have installed a pirated version of SAS and run it successfully before - but it required a little more than just double clicking an installation file. But that's beside the point. Are you undergraduate or graduate student? You should be able to get a 1 year license for about a hundred dollars. Ask around to see if there are any small grants or scholarships which you could apply to in order to cover the cost. In the meantime, University Edition works just fine. 
I like the Head First SQL book, it is beginner based. It isn't specifically for SAS but it teaches concepts in a easy to read style. I knew more SQL when I first came to SAS so I avoided learning some of the other procedures and data steps. I would recommend learning the different tools vs learning one only. 
WTF is this shit?
I don't believe you're familiar with the concept of a question...
I know that it's difficult for most SAS developers to understand the concept of coding conventions since they don't come from a traditional CS background...but this is just keyboard diarrhea. Even though the compiler can parse this into the program data vector and understand it, doesn't mean that anyone else would ever want to read this garbage in it's current state.
I would just bookmark w3schools as a reference instead of spending money on a book. 
The sample sas program requirement might be to assess your programming style: whether you overcomplicate things, how you format your code, whether you indent, comment, label variables, apply formats, and so on. I would show off a sample that demonstrated really strong programming skill in the sense that it is *complete*. In dealing with new hires at my organization, I know how poor programming skills, regardless of SAS expertise, can really hinder team work since people have to spend more time understanding the code and intentions of the programmer.
I'd suggest going to www.stackoverflow.com and posting your question there - there are lots of knowledgeable SAS programmers there. You may well find that if you search the site there will already be some relevant answers.
As long as you can demonstrate that you've made an effort to answer your own questions, you're not directly asking people to write code for you, and the answer is not immediately obvious given a few minutes of searching, people there will probably be happy to help.
Beyond the obvious 'plot as a separate series' or the highly arcane 'use proc greplay with annotation graphics' options, I'm not aware of any way to do that. Just for the avoidance of doubt, it would help if you could post another image showing exactly what you want the final chart to look like.
Well, I think the solution was using proc univariate / proc kde to get estimators for each kernel density line. Then quantify the two points where that "Inexpensive" line intersects the other two. Then, label/display this point on the graph, as well as it's value (somewhere... anywhere...). I'm a bit amateur so it's a bit hard for me to put that all together.
I see them posted on Glassdoor.com from time to time. A lot of them are not permanent and often related to medicine or healthcare. Try setting up a saved search for 'SAS programmer' or related terms. 
Elance, Craigslist, Indeed? Just spitballing - don't know if they work for short term stuff. I feel like I've definitely seen some on linkedin though.
I think I've done something similar using proc means, but I'm on my phone. Also, to make your examples easier to read, add 4 spaces at the beginning of each line. Just Like This
proc sql; create table wesomg as select county, sum(case when sex = 0 then pop else 0 end) as pop_male, sum(case when sex = 1 then pop else 0 end) as pop_female, sum(case when race = 1 then pop else 0 end) as pop_white, sum(case when race = 2 then pop else 0 end) as pop_black from yo_data group by county; quit;
Not very [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and reads the input table 4 times when once will do.
This was the shortest equivalent data step I could think of: data want(keep=county pop_:); do until(last.county); set have; by county; pop_male = sum(pop_male, pop*(sex=0)); pop_female = sum(pop_female, pop*(sex=1)); pop_black = sum(pop_black, pop*(race=1)); pop_white = sum(pop_white, pop*(race=2)); end; run;
If you want to do a lot of these sorts of analyses, it might be worth taking a slightly longer route to the end result in return for something that avoids lots of hard-coding of values to categories: proc summary data = have; by county; var pop; class sex race; ways 1; output out = summary(drop = _:) sum=; run; proc format; value sexfmt 0 = 'male' 1 = 'female' ; value racefmt 1 = 'black' 2 = 'white' ; run; data summary; set summary; if not(missing(sex)) then category = cats('Pop_',put(sex,sexfmt.)); if not(missing(race)) then category = cats('Pop_',put(race,racefmt.)); drop race sex; run; proc transpose data = summary out = summary(drop = _name_); by county; var pop; id category; run;
YES! Thank you, this worked perfectly. I had figured out a workaround, but it was really inefficient. This is exactly what I was looking for.
Any time!

Most of the SAS programmers I know (including myself) are self-taught. For whatever reason my first biostats courses were taught using SPSS. Quickly realized that there was no long term benefit to using SPSS, so I first learned SAS, followed by R, Python, and currently working on Julia. Being able to teach yourself is an excellent skill that'll serve you well over the course of your academic and professional careers. If you have an edu email address you can download SAS's academic suite for free. [Here are some resources to get you started](http://analytics.ncsu.edu/sesug/2003/TD02-Stojanovic.pdf). I used this same document when I first started out and its the first place I point others who are looking to learn. Good luck and I would be glad to answer and questions you may have. 
 /* create data */ data question; do id=3 to 6; output; end; id=9; output; run; /* create differences */ proc sort data=question; by id; run; data question; set question; retain prev; dif1=id-prev; prev=id; drop prev; run; proc sort data=question; by descending id; run; data question; set question; retain prev; dif2=id-prev; prev=id; drop prev; run; /* remove the undesired data */ data question; set question; where dif1~=1 and dif2~=-1; drop dif1 dif2; run; /* result is ok */ proc print ; run; 
I tend to get repetitive code in SAS. But I like the alternative I read from wesomg &gt; sum(case when sex = 0 then pop else 0 end) as pop_male n.b. could have done a not very DRY with a data step too, I now realize.
From a brief inspection of the comments and the code, it looks as though it only takes account of products bought by more than 1 customer each. Do you have access to an example dataset with which the macro is known to work properly? If not, I suggest you try constructing one with dummy data as a proof of concept.
The thing is Iv reduced the products to categories so that there are only about 7 categories and all will have lots of customers buying them. This is the only dataset I have tried it with and I know the data well enough that it should definitely be suitable. Its just a two column dataset - column a with the customer number and b with the product category. Multiple lines where the customer bought from more than one category (which is often the case). I can't imagine how to construct anything to test it since this is already in the right structure and you can see immediately where the customers have bought from multiple categories.
Post the full log please. Make sure you run the line `option mprint;` before you run it.
I think we’re starting to see early signs of R, and to a lesser extent Python, impacting legacy vendors – SAS &amp; SPSS. We’re seeing two populations already using R/Python to the detriment of SAS &amp; SPSS – (1) recent college &amp; business school graduates and (2) technology start-ups as well as large technology companies like Facebook and Google. I think that big companies are already buying fewer liscencses because a lot of the workflow and workforce is being moved over to open source platforms. Over time, large companies will only buy licenses for data scientists that learned SAS and SPSS a while ago and the younger generation will do programming in R and Python. Not sure what the catalyst will be here and would be interested to see how SAS and IBM react… 
Thanks for the reply. These are some pretty significant barriers for open-source platforms to overcome. That said, it does appear that open source platforms are making some traction in certain industries. Just curious to get your view on what you think advanced analytics software will look like in large enterprises in the next 10 years? What role will open source play? What role will SAS / SPSS / MATLAB play? 
I work in finance at one of the largest companies in the US. I can confirm everything you mentioned here is the same in finance.
Look up SAS Essentials 1 and 2 on the internet, both good resources for learning SAS. Also, check out 'The Little SAS Book: A Primer' 4th or 5th edition. That book really helped me when I started in my programming position using SAS. https://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/ is a good place to start. https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us&amp;productType=library is for e-learning modules.
&gt; "The Little SAS Book: A Primer" is a must While you're reading it, skip the chapter on reading data in. You can read the rest without reading that chapter, once you have one SAS dataset.
I'll mention looking into SAS Enterprise Guide. I think it comes packaged with base SAS. It's basically a GUI interface on top of SAS. A person could use it and just write base SAS code or they could use the drop down menus to run PROC Steps and a code wizard will write the code for them. I don't think you could get by in Enterprise very well without any coding, but starting from a blank slate it might suit you. I'll echo the online SAS training available through SAS (also offered in person at some locations, I think). And if you have a local SAS Users Group, that can be a great resource. Best of luck.
Ok, but at the least she could copy the literal SAS program text from one computer to the other and it should execute? i.e. there hasn't been any major changes in the literal programming language that would prevent one version from being runnable on the other?
Great reply! Thanks. Is there something like r/dailyprogrammer that I can refer to? 
SAS 9.2 will read scripts and SAS datasets written in 9.4. There haven't been any major changes in either version that would prevent this. It's probably worth noting that security on the lab's network might be more restrictive than your home network. Of course you could just test both machines with a simple program and dataset. What exactly is she trying to do again? 
She's building a data set from an excel file and 'cleaning it'. Validating values, identifying outliers, etc.
Based on my experience, copying the base SAS code from one instance of Version 9 SAS to another should be fine, as long as she didn't use any procedures new to 9.4. The language is structurally the same between those versions. 
Formatting for Reddit: two "returns" will make a new line, and if you're typing code, put 4 spaces before the line of code, and then you only need one "return." Click the "source" link below this comment and see how I typed it. Onto your question: Here's your code: data returns; set crsp; currentpermno=10449; do %let i=1 to 399; do until(permno ne currentpermno); array stockdata{3} permno date ret; do j=1 to 3; stockdata&amp;amp;i{j}; end; currentpermno = permno; end; A couple of things: What are you trying to do with the array stockdata? That is, when you're done, what do you want it to look like? What variables go where? With... array stockdata{3} permno date ret; ...you're making an array that is 3 cells long, but I don't know what you're trying to do with this: stockdata&amp;i{j}; Finally, you're missing an "end;" statement with the outer do loop, I think. You have one less "end" than you have "do." Also, a "run;" statement at the end of your data step. 
So there aren't any errors there. As far as cleanup goes, just put a new line after each semicolon, and indent everything within a data step, do loop, etc. like you would in most programming languages.
I have 399 stock data that I am trying to separate into different arrays based on their permno number, which ranges from 10449 to 93435. After separating them I can regress the data on the market returns and put these betas in another array. what I'm trying to do with the stockdata&amp;i is get sas to make new arrays: stockdata1, stockdata2, stockdata3....stockdata399. I'm not sure if this is the right approach though... Thanks I did miss the end statements. I'm still used to just closing brackets. Honestly I have no idea what I'm doing and have tried many approaches off of peoples sas websites. Their approaches are very complicated though so I thought this would be easier. 
It will be easier for people to assist you if you post a sample of your raw data and the desired output. Re using things in subsequent calculations- arrays in SAS are just a way of referring to collections of variables within a data step. As soon as the data step where an array is defined finishes executing, the array is gone - only the underlying variables will be left in your output dataset (if you even created one).
ok i see so i need to calculate beta inside the data step. 
Why did you delete the question details? I would have enjoyed figuring it out.
Thanks. Would you happen to know how to save a temporary dataset as a permanent one?
Use the LIBNAME. LIBNAME myLib "C:\path\blah"; DATA myLib.C; MERGE ... etc ...
In your input statement, SAS sees the spaces between words and assumes that each word is a separate variable. So it isn't going to create one variable called "town name", it's going to create two variables, one named "town" and the other named "name". Then it sees all the formatting cues, and another "town", and somewhere along the way it gets confused. Also, the $ should come between the variable name and the position. Generally, when you name SAS variables (or columns), keep them short and only use letters, numerals and underscores (there are other characters you can use, but sticking to these will make it easier). So I'd rewrite the input line as: input town_name $ 1-6 town_number 8-9 month 11-12 year 14-17 low_temp 19-20 high_temp 22-23; If you want to give those variables *labels* so that when doing a proc print they appear the way you've tried to specify, you can do that with this line: label town_name = 'Town Name' town_number = 'Town Number' low_temp = 'Low Daytime Temperature (Farenheit)' high_temp = 'High Daytime Temperature (Farenheit)'; Then, make sure you use the *label* option in the proc print so that the labels display rather than the variable names: proc print label data=sas.temp;
The label statement should come after the input statement in the data step. Sorry, I should have specified that. Then you replace your existing proc print statement with the one I gave (which just means you add the "label" option).
Predictive modeling is a broader term that includes regression. Predictive modeling includes other methods of predictive outcomes based on inputs as well as regression. 
Yes, they are a part of SAS voodoo magic. FIRST and LAST work based on the BY clause which requires a prior SORT. OUTPUT stops output on every record and only outputs records only where you code it.
That alone explains a whole lot. Thank you again. You're handful of comments beat my 8+ hours of googling today. Can't thank you enough.
Add two ampersats (@@) after your variables on input, then you can have multiple observations on a single line
Would you mind expanding a little on the free academic suite? I have searched for this but so far I have found nothing other than where I have to pay. 
sasdate = mdy(mod(yyyymm,100),1,int(yyyymm/100); mdy function creates a sas date from three arguments Month Date Year, in that order as the name implies. mod gives the remainder of the first argument divided by the second argument. 1 is the number one. int gives the integer result of an expression.
Any time!
You should also be able to use the `yymmn6.` date informat to do this, e.g. sasdate = input(put(raw_txt,6.), yymmn6.);
If you are looking at specific observations as they appear in order in the data then use _N_, but you really should use a unique record ID variable if possible. DATA B; SET A; IF _N_ = 15 OR _N_ = 38 OR _N_ = 87 THEN DELETE; RUN;
&gt; sasdate = input(put(raw_txt,6.), yymm6.); Any thoughts? 17 data x; 18 raw_txt = 201411; 19 sasdate = input(put(raw_txt,6.), yymm6.); NOTE 485-185: Informat YYMM was not found or could not be loaded. 
Do you know what the observation values are? If so, then you could just do If (var) = obsvalue then delete; run; And just run that for all 3 values
I left out an `n` - it works now.
I used the following procedure to remove the two Pontiac Sunfire entries in the sashelp.cars dataset: proc sql; create table target as select * from sashelp.cars where monotonic() not in (324,321); quit; I haven't used *monotonic()* much but I do remember reading where there are some cases where it can operate unexpectedly. 
Your dataset is called "allrecords". proc sort data=allrecords; by id iteration; data allrecords; set allrecords; by id; retain retained_name retained_sex retained_age; if first.id then do; if iteration='T1' then do; retained_name=name; retained_age=age; retained_sex=sex; end; else do; retained_name=''; retained_age=''; retained_sex=''; end; end; else do; name=retained_name; age=retained_age; sex=retained_sex; end; run; What this does is, on the first record for each id, it checks if the iteration is T1. If that is true, it fills three variables, retained_age, retained_name and retained_sex. These variables also appear in a "retain" statement, which means their values are held over from observation to observation. If it's the first observation for a particular id and the iteration is not T1, it sets the values of retained_name/age/sex to missing. This is to ensure that if a particular id has missing T1, you aren't accidentally filling in the name/age/sex of the previous id in by mistake. If it is not the first observation for that id, SAS fills in the values of name, age and sex with the retained values, which should be the T1 values for that id. 
Would you mind posting the import code you've tried, along with the output from running the sasinstallreporter macro available [here](http://support.sas.com/kb/20/390.html)?
The code I am using is copy/pasted from using the Import Wizard on a school computer, but get the error following the code when done on my personal computer. To be honest, we have not been taught how to actually write import code, only use the Import Wizard, so while I can make out what is going on with it, it's not something I actually did. PROC IMPORT OUT= WORK.hw3format01 DATAFILE= "F:\EPID6230\SAS3\HW3Format.xls" DBMS=EXCEL REPLACE; RANGE="HW3$"; GETNAMES=YES; MIXED=NO; SCANTEXT=YES; USEDATE=YES; SCANTIME=YES; RUN; Error code: ERROR: Connect: Class not registered ERROR: Error in the LIBNAME statement. Connection Failed. See log for details. Error code when trying to import via Import Wizard, with the data source as a workbook is the same as above. However, when I try to import with the source as a workbook on PC Files Server, it shows: ERROR: CLI error trying to establish connection: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified ERROR: Error in the LIBNAME statement. I do have the actual PC Files Sever service running, however, when I open the actual application, an error window pops up that says "Unable to connect to service/port 9621, Code=3." Report: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2142462/sasinstallreport.lst Edit: Something that occurred to me that may be an issue (new to Windows, as well, so not sure)...I have Windows installed on C:\, but the majority of my applications installed on a different hard drive, D:\.
SAS is physically installed on the PC. Here is the output from what you suggested: NOTE: The infile CMD is: Unnamed Pipe Access Device, PROCESS=net use,RECFM=V,LRECL=256 New connections will be remembered. There are no entries in the list. NOTE: 4 records were read from the infile CMD. The minimum record length was 0. The maximum record length was 35. NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time): real time 0.37 seconds 
What is the error you get when you insert the code block starting with "if ep = A" inside the macro? Incidentally, that should be If "&amp;ep" = "A" 
SAS is trying to read your headers as a record. You can either remove the headers from your input file or, more properly, set the FIRSTOBS option for your infile statement to 2.
Yes, for $1000/hr. Alternatively don't use possibly the worst tool for the job and do it yourself--for example: http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/python-on-the-web/web-scraping-with-beautifulsoup/ 
I presume you mainly want to use SAS for its analytical capabilities. I'd suggest moving the scraping / data extraction logic out of SAS as far as possible - use cURL to download the pages and then use another external utility to convert the html tables to csv or similar, e.g. this one http://table2csv.com/
If the site has changed a lot then you're going to have to update so much code that you might as well rewrite the scraper completely. Personally, I think DrNewton is overcharging you - I'd do it for $995/hr.
It is hard to run regressions on a variable coded as 1,2,3,4. The coefficient on this variable does not have an objective interpretation. Instead, create *four*variables, which can take the values of 0 or 1 only. Call these four variables fairdummy, gooddummy, vergygooddummy and idealdummy. fairdummy takes the value 1 if cut="fair", and 0 otherwise. Likewise for the other three variables. Then you can run regressions of your dependent variable on these four dummy variables. You can also include any other variables in the regression, confident that the cut has been controlled for.
Awesome! You've clarified things a lot for me, thanks a million!
Actually, you'd want to leave out one of your dummy variables as the reference variable to which the effects of the other variables will be measured against. Otherwise, you're setting yourself up for a nasty case of the multicollinearity-itis.
Take out the line with datepart() and try it again I think it will work then.
Perfect...yes that did it. Thanks!
Or you could leave out the intercept.
You can do Step 1 to 3 in a single SQL step. This is not as clear as marstew's step by step unless you are somewhat fluent in SQL. PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE main AS SELECT T1.*, myData.* FROM (SELECT * FROM (SELECT UNIQUE PersonID FROM myData), (SELECT UNIQUE Month FROM myData)) AS T1 LEFT JOIN myData ON T1.PersonID = myData.PersonID AND T1.Month=myData.Month ORDER BY T1.PersonID, T1.Month; QUIT; Then step (4) as per marstew. Note that the Select T1.\*, myData.\* will cause a warning as it tries to include personid and month from both sets. No cause for alarm, but not good practice to have warnings. You can avoid this by specifying each field you want to keep in myData instead of using the wildcard, or renaming the month and personid coming out of T1 (using "AS"). 
I'm fairly sure that it's also possible to do the whole task in a single data step with sufficiently complex code. I might have a go later.
Well, people are entering at all different months. I am just trying to capture all of the person-time. Month 1 varies from person to person. I just want to make sure I capture all possible months. For example, person 1 enters in June 2000 and leaves in December 2000. If data was only collected for them in June, July, and December, they only have 3 rows of information. I want to create a dataset that adds rows for each missing month and then carries forward the last known measurement, So, to answer your question more directly, their 1st month cannot be missing, because I only start looking at their data the first month they have measurements recorded... I hope that was clear! I'm not sure if I'm doing a great job explaining.
The code I posted will still work, except that there will be missing values in early months for persons that start late. You can just delete those.
That would be neat! But might make most people have a nose bleed :)
Your first point is a good one, but I can think of instances where I would want to include that month even though "mymeasure" is missing for all persons. For example, imagine that there are other variables which are not missing in the month where "my measure" is missing. I might reasonably want to run cross-sectional regressions in those months using the latest available values of all variables.
Proc expand is great if you bother to learn the syntax. I didn't, so I prefer the data step way.
If other variables exist then I assume the record with the personid-month would exist. Depends if we are only looking at a dataset with the single variable with non-missing or the full data set. I was thinking if the whole month was not collected for all variables for all participants. But yes, the world is a mix of requirements, and there may well be a need to fill out a completely lost month.
As promised - how to do this in one data step. This assumes for the sake of simplicity that `mth` starts at 1 and is supposed to include every integer up to and including 6, with assorted missing rows. data have; input id mth char $; cards; 1 1 a 1 2 c 1 4 g 2 1 f 2 2 e 2 3 h 3 2 q 3 3 j ; run; data want; /*Create an array to hold the mths present for each id*/ array mths{6} _temporary_; /*Loop through the by group to populate the array*/ do _n_ = 1 by 1 until(last.id); set have; by id; mths[_n_] = mth; end; /*Set all data except mth and the array fields to missing*/ call missing(char); /*Output missing values for all months up until the first one with valid data*/ mth = 1; do while(mth &lt; mths[1]); output; mth + 1; end; do _n_ = 1 by 1 until(last.id); set have; by id; /*Output each row*/ output; /*Use the array to 'peek ahead' to see what the next mth with valid data is*/ if last.id then next_mth = 6 + 1; else next_mth = mths[min(_n_ + 1,6)]; /*Output the current row enough times to fill the gap up to the next mth with valid data*/ mth + 1; do while(mth &lt; next_mth); output; mth + 1; end; end; drop next_mth; run;
Agreed. The syntax is unique, but so much power.
Wow. Thank you so much. I'm working through it now... I'll be back to update my progress :)
Saving for future reference...so impressive. Thank you!
It can work. Instead of using "month" as the variable, use "year month". So for example, in step 1, replace proc sort data=mydata(keep=month) out=listofmonths nodupkey; by month; with proc sort data=mydata(keep=year month) out=listofyearmonths nodupkey; by year month; and proceed similarly. If you want to be fancy, use the month-end date instead. So create a list of month end dates (for example, 31Dec2001) and just use the *monthenddate* variable in place of the *month* variable in the original code.
Worked like a charm. Thanks so much for your help. 
 Not sure I understand. Why can't you just report the p-values? 
I suppose I can. With a X², I think the proper way to note something is like *X²(N,df) = Chi, p = x*. For Fisher's Exact, I think it's just the p-value, *P = x, Fisher's Exact test*. But per u/eulerdman, I'm guessing something like this is needed: *P = x, Seed = x, Simulations = x, Fisher's Exact test/Monte Carlo*? I guess I want to know what information needs to be given with the P-value for this test-- I'm not familiar with using a Monte Carlo option, but would you include a standard error? That sort of thing. 
I've never done that, I've always said something like "We used Fisher's exact test with MC when necessary". The differences between MC runs are teeny. 
I would just change that symbol to a standard missing value, which is " " for categorical variables and . for numerical variables. This would only take one line of code in a DATA procedure. 
Yeah, either change it or write a format to handle it.
Just as you wrote here. Data abc; Set abc; If x = y then newvariable = 1; else newvariable = 0; Run;
You need to be more clear. This is happening within in row, and to all rows within the whole data set. Did you want operations across rows (RETAIN)? Or only specific rows (\_N\_)?
I suggest you post an example of the sort of input and output you have in mind.
Nope; that's what the "1way" in npar1way means. If you want to do a nonparametric regression controlling for more than 1 variable, consider doing a median regression using proc quantreg (if your data are suited for it). 
A SAS library is typically used as a way of referring to a collection of files in one or more folders, rather than just a single file. Have a look at the documentation for the libname statement. When you're working with non-SAS files, filename statements are more commonly used to refer to just one file at a time. 
Will do. Thank you.
LIBNAME refers to the folder or to a container of tables where the OS allows (e.g. 32bit version directly LIBNAME to MS Access database), also you might be required to use forward slashes if you're using the free version - the free version has an extra step of setting up shared folders for the virtual machine. If that folder contains data sets in SAS format then you can refer to them by their name. LIBNAME monkeybutt "c:\path\morepath\"; * List tables in the library; PROC DATASETS LIB=monkeybutt; RUN; * Process data; PROC FREQ DATA=monkeybutt.banana; TABLE jungle; RUN; 
With a "by" variable. Instead of: proc standard data=mydata out=mydata mean=0 std=1; var mystockreturn; run; do: proc standard data=mydata out=mydata mean=0 std=1; by year month; var mystockreturn; run; 
That did not paste correctly, here are links: The data: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/MpQonlu.png) The program: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/HlfvGFG.png)
I just ran it, and had no invalid data problem, so I'm not sure what's up there. The Type warning is just because you "define" it but then never actually use it.
Yes, that is exactly how the results should look. For some reason my Output is producing a row between East and West called, "NM" with a missing value ("."), the number "2" and another missing value.
and my Log says this: NOTE: Invalid data for Museums in line 62 26-29. RULE: ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7----+----8----+ 62 Dinosaur NM West 2 6 ParkName= Type=Dinosaur Region=NM Museums=. Camping=2 _ERROR_=1 _N_=1 NOTE: SAS went to a new line when INPUT statement reached past the end of a line. 
btw my above comment was in reference to removing 'define Type / Group' in the PROC REPORT. I still get the error and the extra line in the Output. 
thanks!
I did, just couldn't seem to find a good one. Thanks, I'm going to try this tomorrow
There are many things that you can do, but you have to be very wary of the validity of your methods and should be up-front in your reporting about your method. Interpolation of data is a field that requires a good deal of thought about assigning values to missing, or just allowing the analysis to evaluate the field as missing. Simply put, if you have missing values in an analysis that doesn't explicitly allow missing values then that whole record is excluded from the analysis. An example; say your field is "race" and it is not recorded for a number of records, but you are aware that people recording the information will sometimes only enter race when it is something unusual. You could then re-code the missing values to the majority race. I would also suggest a sensitivity test. Alternatively, you may only be interested in a specific race, you could code a new variable with the definition as "identified as xyz race" as Yes/No (1/0) which means a missing race value is coded as "No" because they were not identified as the race. Again, make sure you have this anomaly listed in your methods in your report. DATA mySet; SET mySource; Indigenous = 0; IF Race = 2 THEN Indigenous = 1; LABEL Indigenous = "Identified as indigenous in the data"; RUN; PROC FREQ DATA=mySet; TABLE Smoking * Indigenous /CMH; RUN;
Interestingly the problem was that I left a space between DATALINES and the actual data set, which when removed does not cause the issues I was having.
Hi there- As a person who took Base SAS 1 with zero knowledge, I can tell you that you'll get more out of a 3 day class if you have some point of reference to start from. Since you're already employed, I'd go with this chain of events: First, get SAS installed on your machine. Second, get someone at the company to show you how to log on to the remote servers (if you have them) Next, get some legacy code from another LOB in your company. Try to replicate some tables that they have created in the past. Also, dis: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/ 
What you're looking for is [time constants](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/62955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000780334.htm). I am not sure if the 24 hour clock works, so you may have to do the am/pm deal. proc print data=test3; where time_part &gt; '17:30:00't; run; proc print data=test3; where time_part &gt; '5:30:00pm't; run;
Neo, they both work to the same effect. Thanks again bud.
Ah easy enough, thank you
Hi TM, Would you be able to provide a snippit of some code?
How big is the list of names? If a reasonably small list AND the names don't contain spaces: DATA myOut; SET myData; Flag = 0; DO j = 1 TO 8; * there are 8 codes in the string below; IF INDEX(myVar, SCAN("J450 J451 J458 J459 J46 T486 Y556 Z825",j)) THEN Flag = 1; END; IF Flag = 1 THEN OUTPUT; RUN; Note if your names do contain spaces then you need to fiddle with delimiters to get the above to work. If you have a unique record ID: PROC SQL; CREATE TABLE myOut AS SELECT * FROM myData, myNames WHERE INDEX(STRIP(myData.myVar), STRIP(myNames.Name)) &gt; 0 ORDER BY ID; QUIT; DATA myOut; * Strip out repeats; SET myOut; BY ID; IF First.ID; RUN; You will also need to consider if names contain names (e.g. text may be "fred" but you only want "red", the above code will give a false match); do you want to search for a properly delimited word vs just the exact character string.
Thanks for the guidance- I will give this a try today. The "list" has strings that contain spaces in them. There is a unique key in the 'myData' table so I might try your second approach first. There are 63 names in the 'myNames' table for reference on size. As far as the false positives go I will run a first pass and see what pops up. Thanks for the guidance.
the problem started when i added the do x=1 to 1000 loop, but i'm not sure what the problem is. 
basically it is preparing data for a rolling beta calculation. The beta will be calculated for a three year time period each month. I first aim to create arrays that try to capture the right part of the data. I can get the arrays to become 1's where i need them but i still need to find a way to get the 756 days of data (the 1's keep going down until each last.permno. I don't want that I want only 756 days of data for each array.
Hi Neo, It didn't work, but I think we are heading in the right direction. I'm not too familiar with SQL, but I do know it does the kind of functions I need. I apologize for being unclear; "I want to set this dataset with the original". I want to 'stack' the two datasets on top each other. A merge I see as a way to make datasets wider, not longer (if that makes sense). I posted this in the SAS community forums: Original Modified New A A A B B B C E E D G G D H H E I H F H F I G I H H H I I So the letters represent the patient ID. The 'original' column is the column dataset with all the data. The 'modified' column is the dataset with the patient IDs that had a vist past 5:30. The 'new' column is the dataset in where all the observations from the 'modified' are present, as well as any observations with the same patient IDs, regardless of the time of visit. These additional observations can be found in 'original' but not 'modified'. TM (EDIT: Sorry about the wobbly 3rd column. Just a formatting issue, not symbolic of anything lol)
I like it. thankyou.
 do x=1 to 1000; /*Outer loop start*/ do until (before_months(x) = 756); /*Inner loop start*/ if before_months(x) = 1 then before_months(x) = before_months(x) + 1; end; /*Inner loop end*/ end; /*Outer loop end*/ x isn't changing in the inner loop, so it just keeps going forever.
If you had AMO, it should be fine. Else try vba.
 x=0; do until (before_months(x) = 756); x+1; if before_months(x) = 1 then before_months(x) +1; end; From the looks of your code I think this is what you're going for?
thanks for trying but I think I'm going to have to abandon this approach entirely. It just seems like I won't be able to get the data how I want because i need the same data for multiple arrays and everytime i count the array then it stops the calculation for the previous array. The good thing is another poster posted a particularly helpful way of calculating what I'm trying to do so it should be smooth sailing from here.
Well that is a nice way of passing arguments. I should try this. At the moment I don't need VBA to pick up the output although I can imagine that that would be handy. For example if I want to return a SAS dataset as the output of an array function in Excel.
I'm on my phone, but something something retain.
I do have some basic familiarity with sql at least with merging because I ran into this problem before but ran to the TA. They sent me back some sql code. Thanks for letting me know the right direction to look.
I'm curious - under what circumstances have you found that SQL is hundreds of times faster than an equivalent merge?
I had a macro to read web log files dating back to mid 2000s, a file for each day so there were thousands of imports with a merge to a main data table. I changed the merge part to SQL and noted phenomenal run time reduction. I benchmark nearly everything I do, so I am also aware that there is large variation in run times for code that has not even been changed; likely due to your system conditions: mem available, cached connections, network speed etc. Last benchmark was a link on ID of 10 million records (~1Gig data) MERGE: 4:23, SQL: 0:08. Highly recommend adding the following code to the start and end of your large SAS scripts. * BENCHMARK! START; %LET BenchStartTime = %sysfunc(time()); * your code here.; * BENCHMARK! REPORT; %PUT Execution time: %sysfunc(putn(%sysfunc(time()) - &amp;BenchStartTime, time.)) (h:m:s); 
Did this involve making a pass-through query to another database to read the logs? That's a very impressive time saving, and I'm keen to understand what could have driven it.
So basically you just want to delete all patients that do not have a visit after 5:30? Or am I misinterpreting?
No, I want to delete all the patients whose history does include a visit after 5:30. I am interested in the full history of those patients with a visit after 5:30.
You say you want to mark the visits that you want to keep with a 1, but it seems you already have that with your indicator variable. Am I missing something or could you not just do: data new; set old; if indicator=1; run;
Note: There was a type in my first post. 'indicator2' should have been 'indicator'. No, I do not have an indicator variable. These datasteps create that variable. if first.patient_id and evening=1 then do; indicator = 1 ; end; This is marking some of the visits I want to include; the first ones in a group if the first one is an evening visit.
A first thing that you should be doing is using: If first.patient_id then indicator=0; If evening=1 then indicator=1; This "clears" the indicator at the first date for that patient. The way you have it set up it will carry over values from the past patient to the current patient. For example, if the previous patient had visited the doctor after 530, then the value of indicator for the first visit of the current patient will be 1 even if that visit was before 530. It's not clear to me why you're getting what you say you're getting, though. 
I'm surprised - I've never yet seen a reproducible scenario where proc sql does the same thing (i.e. without offloading any of the work to an external dbms) significantly faster than an equivalent set of sorts/merges. As it stands, you don't quite have a fair comparison, for two reasons: * You're keeping all vars from both tables for both the sort and the merge, whereas in the SQL all vars except `myvar` and `id` will be dropped from T1 right at the start of the execution of the query. * The merge (as written) outputs rows that are present in T2 but not T1, whereas the SQL doesn't. All other things being equal, I suspect that you would find that if you addressed these points, there would be very little difference in performance.
I'm confused as to how the evening variable we have is different from the indicator variable we want.
INDICATOR "turns to" 1 when the current observation has EVENING=1. But the RETAIN statement means that the indicator variable *stays* at its current value unless it is changed. So if a previous observation made INDICATOR turn to 1, it will stay 1 even if the current observation has EVENING=0. 
I "think" the issue is the by should only have patient. Also need to clear for first. as the other guys said. Edit: Not sure who downvoted me for giving the right answer here.... Whatever &gt;data old; &gt;input patient_id date time; &gt;datalines; &gt;1 201401 1200 &gt;1 201402 1700 &gt;1 201403 1600 &gt;1 201405 2100 &gt;2 201401 0800 &gt;2 201402 1800 &gt;2 201405 1400 &gt;3 201401 1800 &gt;; &gt;run; &gt;proc sort data = old; &gt;by patient_id date time; &gt;run; &gt;data new; &gt;set old; &gt;by patient_id; &gt;retain indicator; &gt;if first.patient_id then indicator = 0; &gt;if time ge 1700 then indicator = 1; &gt;run; 
You have an extra "(" in the line defining *M*.
As a follow up... Could not get it to work. I am having someone else help me debug the issues. The logic will make it run for a few hours and nothing gets returned. I assume it is due to the fact that your second idea, each record has to have the index function run on each observation 64 times. The final solution (kindergarten approach) was to run a where clause in my data step that had 64 LIKE clauses with OR operators between them. With the size of the table I am searching in, it takes about 10 minutes for it to run. Thanks again for your assistance and responding to my request!
What kind of hardware is it running on? What does the log say? What is the size of the observations?
Glad you found it! Hope it helps. If it doesn't work on Mac let me know and I'll bring that up internally to see if we can get a JMP university edition going too.
Yes, SAS University Edition will work on a Mac. It will work on any platform that can run either VMWare Player or Virtualbox. (SAS employee here, though I don't work on SAS UE.)
Could you tell me what JMP is exactly? Is it just an extension of SAS?
I'm actually a SAS employee too, but I work in SSOD, so I'm not really familiar with SAS UE either ;)
after about 30 minutes the log says the sas tast name is [REG] Error: read access violation reg exception occured at (01F1C3B5) Error: an exception has been encountered. Please contact technical support and provide the following traceback information. The SAS task name is [REG] Error: Read Access Violation REG Exception occurred at (01F1C3B5)
Not to be self promoting, but [I provide SAS youtube videos for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6JU4JQQw-mqS8NqfzeYWgQ). There's only a few but they're intended to give you the basics. Hope it helps!
You're comparing apples to oranges again. The SQL is updating the dataset in place, but each data step is actually doing the following: * Read in the whole dataset one row at a time * Add 1 row (from the second data set in the set statement) * Replace the whole original dataset A fairer comparison would be to use `proc append`, or to run a single data step that appends everything in one go.
Ah excellent - and proc append gets the same benchmark as INSERT, exceedingly faster than the DATA step. For those following along: PROC APPEND BASE=I2 DATA=I1; RUN; &gt; You're comparing apples to oranges again. "*again*"? Come on dude.
I've found the JMP-&gt;SAS setup to be very cumbersome. It is also dependent on your school having a SAS server that will allow you to interface with JMP.
 It's easier if you tell us about your models. Assuming that you've got linear growth models, you've got measures of people within time. Each person has an intercept, and these vary between people. So there's a variance there. Each person has a slope. These vary between people. There's variance there. Depending on your covariance structure, there might be a covariance there. What this means and whether it matters depends on your model and what you want to know. Often you want those parameters in the model because then the model is correctly specified and the rest of the parameters are trustworthy.
I know of several Mac users who run SAS with Parallels or Boot Camp-- Boot Camp is much quicker than Parallels, but you would have to partition the hard drive and working on two OS's is annoying. (If you have a need to run Windows software for other reasons, it wouldn't be a bad idea to dual boot.) Your other option might be to use R ( r/rstats ) or SPSS. R of course is free and really the only other stats software that I would wholly recommend learning outside of SAS, but SPSS has the code free GUI that people seem to like. Both are Mac friendly.
I love R! The problem is Im starting to get into some things that are a little bit easier to do in SAS than R (for example I find multivariate analysis easier in SAS than R). I might end up running bootcamp but my computer is getting older so I dont know how quickly itll run. 
Yea I downloaded the free trial of JMP before buying it. After messing around with it for a while I can see why it might be better for some people (i.e people afraid of anything that looks like programming) I dont think itll do what I need it to do. 
Thanks mate, what I meant though is what is the 'estimate' parameter? is it a correlation? I'm assuming whatever it is i want the standard error to be quite small. I'm going to have to brush up on my mixed models I'm quite new to both SAS and mixed models 
I don't think they allow that with standard licensing. There are separate products they sell that allows that kind of thing, but I haven't used them (or even heard of them in the last few years.)
It works perfectly, thank you VERY much ! Have a nice day !
300+ classes? Ah, macro output combo would do it. You could build the course code rapidly by getting a nice list of the course names by listing the variables and some neat grep exclusions on _grade then replace the CrLf with );%doCourse( There is probably a trickier way to grab the field list automatically using *open attrn varname* if you're willing to spend some time, but with some modest grep search/replace skills you will have the %doCourse list done in no time. PROC CONTENTS ORDER=VARNUM SHORT DATA=myOldData; RUN; %MACRO doCourse (className); IF &amp;className = "Yes" THEN DO; Course = "&amp;className"; Grade = &amp;className._Grade; OUTPUT; END; %MEND; DATA myNewData (KEEP = ID Course Grade); SET myOldData; LENGTH Course $16; %doCourse(Math); %doCourse(Art); %doCourse(English); * ... etc; RUN;
I made a few tweaks to the code above, so make sure you re-copy it.
I'm glad it worked!
You can't do that. If you need to use SAS, your only option is a client-server model using SAS Integration Technologies (specifically the IOM). R+RInside and Stata Numerics are far better options for making a redistributable, standalone application.

I thought about that, but I thought I'd spell it out a little more. You're absolutely right though.
I'm assuming you're using proc print to display your dataset. You need to use the `label` option in the proc print statement to get it to use labels instead of variable names. If you open up the dataset in a viewtable window instead, I expect you'll see the labels.
Your data step is fine, and the label *statements* are fine whether you put them within the data step or the proc print. However, regardless of where the label statements go, you still need to use the label *option*. E.g. this will show the variable names, even though a label is specified: proc print data = sashelp.class; label sex = 'Hello world'; run; This will actually use the label: proc print label data = sashelp.class; label sex = 'Hello world'; run; 
Ah I see now...I was not placing 'label' prior to 'data,' now everything works as it should. Thank you.
Rather than using SVN or anything sensible we wrote a SAS macro to do it. It does the job, albeit with a fairly basic feature set (check out / check in / promote). Only one person ever usually needs to work on any one program at any one point in time, so this is adequate for us. In a mostly separate environment, one of our contractors used TortoiseSVN for a while, which also worked perfectly well.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Little-SAS-Book-Edition/dp/1599947250
Yup, sounds like that's the most recommended book. A little different than what I was looking for, but it should be very useful.
Disclaimer: I have never read or purchased any SAS books. I just pick things up as I go along from other people's code, the SAS help file, www.stackoverflow.com and the online documentation.
I kept diving and found that they are indeed equivalent, I'ma leave this up in case anyone in the future is curious.
You can try using ODS. Run ODS TRACE ON; before the PROC ANOVA. The log will show you the name of each element that is output. If the plots you want are listed, then you can add a line to you PROC ANOVA code: PROC... ; MODEL... ; ODS OUTPUT odsplotname=wantedplot; RUN; 
SAS dates and date times are different numbers. SAS dates are stored as the number of *days* since Jan 1, 1960, date times are stored as the number of *seconds* since then, formatting just changes how you see it. data time_fun; current_time = time(); format current_time timeampm.; unformated_current_time = time(); current_date = date(); format current_date mmddyy10.; unformated_current_date = date(); current_date_time = (today()*86400)+time(); format current_date_time datetime20.; unformated_current_date_time = (today()*86400)+time(); run; This example should help. YRDIF requires dates, not datetimes. You can also get the current date time by using **datetime()**. The 86,400 comes from 60 seconds in a minute, 3600 seconds in an hour, 86,400 seconds in a day. Dates and datetimes will drive you nuts until you get it sorted out. Hopefully this helps. 
This is probably a roundabout way, but I came across DATEPART - used that to pull the date from CVD (which was in DATETIME) into a new variable, then used YRDIF on the new variable and DateOfBirth to get my desired variable, VisitAge.
That will work, you can actually use the date part on CVD within the YRDIF function as well, to save you a step.
Look in your install doc if you have one. Do you have access to Portal or other web apps? Their URLs should be something like: [some server address]:[port number]/SASPortal Just replace SASPortal with SASWebReportStudio
It is, Go to SASMC, and look under Configuration Manager, In the plugins tab go to Configuration Manager -&gt; SAS Application Infrastructure -&gt; SAS Web Report Studio Right click on the configration profile and go to the "Internal Connections" This screen shows everything you need it should be Communication Protocol:PortNumber//HostName/Service TYPICALLY it's http://SERVERNAME:8080/SASWebReportStudio or http://SERVERNAME/SASWebReportStudio YOU will need to be a SAS admin in order to even see the configuration manager. 
Look into the SAS Stored Process Web Application. Essentially it runs SAS on a server, but can take input from a website and produce output, including a csv file.
SAS skills to me (separating out statistics and visualization) are about knowledge of slicing and dicing data and knowledge of what pitfalls there are in working with data. Both come with practice. Take your datasets, maybe two related ones, and think of some basic questions you should be able to answer from the data, or even things that are assumed obvious about the data. Then join the datasets and try to answer those questions or validate those assumptions. I really like the topics covered in the Base Cert. exam, which you probably covered in those classes. Applying those to problems will get you an intuition for how to best solve problems and expand your awareness of what is possible. &gt;just trying to come up with programs? Come up with business problems or questions and try to answer them through data analysis. A few things that are important that I don't think are covered in the material you looked at * proc sql - will also introduce you to database structure concepts * proc transpose * regular expressions - you don't usually need them but when you do, it's magic
Is there existing stuff to output to JSON? Or are you suggesting doing it in pure code? I keep telling my co-workers about my work "these results are cool, but if I knew JavaScript better..."
Thanks for this detailed reply - this is really helpful!
In terms of the standard Base licence, you're not allowed to expose SAS directly to a web-based user interface from which they can submit their own code. But, there's nothing stopping you have a web interface which accepts user-specified parameters, and passing them back to a SAS program, and returning the results to the user, e.g. a PHP-based form which writes the user input to a file, then a SAS program (running on a regular schedule, say every 5 minutes) which uses the URL filename method to read that file, run a program, generate results, FTP them back to the webserver, from which another PHP scripts then reads.
Outputting to JSON can be done two ways. First is to output it to a specific file using [PROC JSON] (http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/proc/67327/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n0nejfk9q0pzmnn181l92qk3ah2e.htm) This will produce a text file that contains a JSON object from a sas data set. It's pretty cool, but requires a static place to put the file. The other option I'd reccomend is to use this along with a Stored Process Web Applacition to use your existing SAS midtier (if you have SAS Integration Techologies) to build you a web application. This [example](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/stpug/67499/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p1m8j53px3ckx7n0zngtlmtm29ev.htm) available at support.sas.com gives you some example of how this works. Essentially you use the data step to output to a web browser. It's pretty cool. 
Using arrays: DATA GRADE_T (KEEP=ID Course Grade); SET GRADE; ARRAY GRADE_SUB _NUMERIC_; DO OVER GRADE_SUB; IF GRADE_SUB &gt; 0 AND index(VNAME(GRADE_SUB),'Grade') THEN DO; Course = TRANWRD(VNAME(GRADE_SUB),"_Grade",""); Grade = GRADE_SUB; OUTPUT; END; END; RUN; 
Hi, I've got full SAS admin but I get as far as 'SAS Application Infrastructure ' but it's empty, I can however see Web Report Studio further down, I have the url. It's as you said, however it won't connect, I've checked the services, I can get a generic JBoss page if I go to http://SERVERNAME:8080, but nothing SAS will work, not even /SASAdmin. I've gone through the WRS logs and only once person has used it in the last 6 months so we're going to disable it anyway, thanks for the help.
Hmm, It sounds like the SAS applications aren't loading properly. IF you want to resolve the issue I suggest using the Deployment Manager to [REBUILD your Web applications](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/bimtag/65708/HTML/default/viewer.htm#p0plwle8uj04upn1vrsbstiwkhmz.htm) and your web applications and then [REDEPLOY your web applications](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/bimtag/65708/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n02nbqc1n26j7gn1lgpbgss3ev8p.htm). This will likely solve your problem. 
Thanks, this came about as we're [finally] migrating from 9.2 to 9.4 and just wanted to check no-one is using WRS so that they don't need to bother setting it up under 9.4. I've spoken to SAS and checked the logs (C:\SAS92\Config\Lev1\Web\Logs\SASWebReportStudio4.3.log) they advised and it looks like basically no-ones using it so it should be fine. As the 9.4 install is currently underway so at this stage it's not worth doing the rebuild. I appreciate you taking the time to respond and provide the links though. Thanks.
Another thing to remember: when joining datasets extracted from different databases or file types, make sure the fields used for the join are formatted the same way, and exclude nulls from the join! 
Or better yet use `run cancel;` instead of `run;` - if you're reading from a large non-indexed dataset with a where clause it can take ages just to get 1 observation.
The only advantage of single quotes in my experience is that they allow me to avoid using macro quoting functions in the rare cases when I *don't* want to resolve things that look like macro syntax. They're also a bit more compact if you need to specify a (hard-coded) file path containing spaces when invoking an OS command from within SAS, e.g. `systask command "'c:\awkward folder\myapp.exe'";` vs. `systask command """c:\awkward folder\myapp.exe""";`
On a related note, data step merges don't give you a full cartesian product if more than one dataset has multiple records in a by group.
Instead of using SAS on new projects, use R or python instead.
You'll do a reverse sort then look into a retain function to carry the values down.
data DataSet1; set DataSet; by id; retain x1-x4; array x {4} $ x1-x4; if first.id then do i = 1 to 4; x{i} = ''; end; if last.id; run; data DataSet2; set DataSet1; if x1^=. then x=x1; else if x1=. and x2^=. then x=x2; and so on. merge back with datasat. get the idea? 
It causes the preceding code (data step or proc) to be compiled and checked for syntax errors without being executed. This doesn't work for proc sql, as that uses a quit statement - the equivalent option there would be `proc sql noexec;`
First suggestion, this is how I would do it: proc means data = income nway noprint; class age_gender; output out = means_raw (drop=_:) mean(income)=; run; proc transpose data = means_raw out = means_final (drop=_:) prefix = mean_; id age_gender; var income; run; The second way would be: data income_mod (drop=income); set income; if age_gender = "young_male" then young_male = income; if age_gender = "young_female then young_female = income; if age_gender = "old_male" then old_male = income; if age_gender = "old_female" then old_female = income; run; proc means data = income_mod noprint; var young_male young_female old_male old_female; output out = means_final (drop=_:) mean= /autoname; run; Good luck! By the way, you could do it all in a single step with proc sql, let me know if that's of interest.
Cheers!
Interesting read, but that is using predictor variables to test different models. I feel like upsets are impossible to predict and actually randomly generated.
&gt;Got to say this is fairly frustrating at this point as this is just simple stuff I need to do before I even get properly started that seems to be ridiculously convoluted and difficult. Welcome to SAS programming 
I don't think this is possible using `proc gbarline` alone. The only way I think you could make this work would be to render 2 separate plots, using the same axis information but different data (one for missing, one for non-missing), save them to a graphics catalogue, and then overlay them via `proc greplay`.
Sas certified guy here. I recommend getting the sas certification guide book. It is the absolute best resource for the exam. Even though you might be good at the data step, joins, merges, sql etc. the base certification has a significant portion based on knowledge of various procs like proc summary, proc tabulate proc means etc. So even though I don't use those much in my life of work, I had to learn them for the exam. Each chapter in the book has a test section where you can try your knowledge right away. After you are done with the whole book, try all the tests, refresh your knowledge in the sections you scored badly on, then immediately take the exam. There are websites like quizlet.com that have a number of questions for free, you can try that too for practice. Good luck!

Is your date variable formatted as a date in SAS?
http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63347/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_glm_sect056.htm
The variable is numeric, and all the birthyears are written as: DD/MM/YY. And every value represented a date since 1960, and i got data until until 2012. so that equals (2012-1960)*365 =18980 values. 
You are supposed to filter it by using the **year** function. So if you named your variable *BirthDate* then your code should say where year(BirthDate) = 2002; not where BirthDate = 2002; If you want to filter a date range you can do it with the help of **mdy()** function. (It stands for month/day/year.) where BirthDate &gt;= mdy(1, 1, 2002) and BirthDate &lt;= mdy(12, 31, 2002);
~~That works nicely, actually. If I wanted to add Saturdays to the mix, how would that work?~~ Nevermind, got it! thanks!
Okay great thanks, im gonna try that. 
I wrote a dbf reader in pascal - would not recommend doing this in SAS. The code would quite complex as dbf is a binary format with a binary formatted header.
This is the correct response. Don't reinvent the wheel. Focus instead on learning to use infile to import text files - this can get very complex before you even think about dealing with binary data. However, if you ever do need to read in binary data and there is no ready-made proc or driver (not something I've ever had to do), you may want to look into the [pib informat](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000204439.htm). 
wow, never knew this. i was google mashing "infile dbf" and I think the proc dbf solves it! :)
What is the intent of this meeting over coffee? I think it would be interesting to know what kind of problems that hotels face that can be solved with data analysis. Ask how she uses SAS. Is it to pull and parse a large amount of data? Does she use other programs like excel, tableau, or jmp to create reports off of outputs from SAS? Some people use SAS from data query all the way to report creation. Others use SAS just to pull and create easy-to-use datasets which another program creates end-user reporting off of. Still, others do heavy statistical analysis work to create sophisticated mathematical models of processes. 
I'd ask what sorts of career opportunities she thinks SAS proficiency will open up, and how best to develop one's skills in order to take advantage of them. What SAS-related resources does she consider to be the most useful? As an undergrad, I would recommend you have a look at as many of the most commonly used programs as you can. In particular there is a free University Edition of SAS that you should probably look into. Also, R is free and is definitely worth a look as it's one of the main rivals to SAS.
I went to my first user group meeting this week and was talking to a friend there I hadn't seen in awhile. He brought up SAS Abbreviations and asked if I had used them. I hadn't but quickly started. They are especially useful for things like loading a standard header, or loading the syntax to procedures that I often forget. One I like is I have an abbreviation for looping through a macro variable list. So when I type "mloop" it loads: %local i; %do i=1 %to %sysfunc(countw(/*varlist*/)); %let var=%scan(/*varlist*/,&amp;i,%str( )); %end; Anyway I thought it was a cool tip that was something easily overlooked.
I'm glad it worked!
I see now. Thanks!
As I mentioned in the post, that won't work. You need to join a defined column from one datatable to another defined column in the other datatable when merging. The column in the second datatable is dependent on a variable from the first datatable (age). Thanks for the reply though!
Then I'm not understanding. Give me an example of your data.
It would be much easier if ages were stored in the same numbered variables as the age itself, or blank. i.e. if age=70 and age70 is 70, but age71 is missing or zero. You can easily get the array value in this case. proc sort data=table1; by ID; proc sort data=table2; by ID; data lookup(Keep=ID Age); merge table1(in=A) table2(in=B); by ID; Array AgeList[80] Age0-Age79; if (A&amp;B) and AgeList[Age] = Age then output; run;
You rock! Thank-you so much for the help, it works!
Thanks but /u/nkris's solution is working.
Full join and then apply where . Look into hash programing as well. It's meant for lookup tables. 
1. It is good to document what you know - not in terms of proprietary code, but in generic terms, for yourself as a reference. It would also help you list your skills on your resume. No company would like you to store their code on your private computer (or worse, a public website), it would be grounds for termination. You wouldn't get hired by any other company either if they came to know of it. Even though you wrote it, it belongs to the company. 2. SAS certifications are worth getting for getting an interview. Your resume will stand out (SAS gives you a cool little logo that you can add to your resume claiming you are SAS certified.) Once you get the interview, it is all up to you to actually get the job. If you are interested in a SAS job in the Twin Cities, MN area, message me. We are looking for one in our team.
This sounds like an issue that is local to your office/company. I'd contact your system admin to help you on this. 
**5.** The question is misprinted. There should only be 4 choices: a)proc sort.... b)dat sasuser.mysales.... c)proc print.... d)none of the above. So the choice is b) which is "dat sasuser.mysales" instead of "data sasuser.mysales" **6.** Again, another issue with the answer list. They have only printed one program out of 4, and marked the 4 statements in the program as choices. i.e. all the 4 statements represent only the first answer choice. The other 3 choices are missing. 
oh jeez, i see it now. thanks. i omitted the later portion of question 6 since i didn't think it mattered (it was like question 5).
Thanks for the feedback! That's quite a bit different of an answer than what I had originally, dang...
The formatting of the data does not have any influence on condition. Try using single equal to sign instead of double.
I only know of first party resources (provided by SAS).. One is like a 600 something page reference, and the other is the book used in the training. The reference book should be freely available on their website as a pdf, if you've bought the software. One thing I've noticed though, is that there aren't many 3rd party references (YouTube vids, books, discussion forums, etc) available. I assume VA is simply not a very popular platform or its still in its infancy.
VA is still pretty new. We're having a hard time finding any type of admin or user classes. In fact, last year they were not available at all even through SAS. I did notice SAS has some VA videos on their YouTube channel but they be more for marketing rather than training.
For the summary statistics, proc summary will definitely get you the means, and you could probably create and output set and then rejoin it back to your original dataset if there are other vars you need. But you can do it in one step with proc sql: proc sql; create table whatevs as select distinct date, mean(numerical_value) as average from table t1 group by date ; quit; u/conmanau's merge should work, or you can do it in proc sql as well if you don't want to sort: Proc sql; create table newtable as select t1.date ,t1.desired_vars ,t2.desired_vars from table1 t1 inner join table2 t2 on (t1.date=t2.date) where t2.numerical_var is not null /*if there are null values*/ ; quit; 
Here you go http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/va64/ Replace 64 with 63 or 71 depending on your version of Visual Analytics. The videos are pretty awesome!
The video library is pretty extensive for VA. http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/va64/[1] Replace 64 with 63 or 71 depending on your version of Visual Analytics.

I think you're right. Proc Arima is part of SAS/ETS which you have to buy separately from SAS/STAT.
Darn. So they only way to do it without buying a license would be to use SAS on demand?
Not sure. I guess so. There's also R, which is free, and if you just have the one analysis to do, it might not be so hard. (Get your data prepped in SAS, dump into R, run analysis.)
Hi In the following link you find an very good introduction to proc gchart with everything you want to know and more. [http://www.nesug.org/proceedings/nesug07/ff/ff17.pdf](http://www.nesug.org/proceedings/nesug07/ff/ff17.pdf)
That's because all observations have the same response. run: proc freq data=poof; tables CAhype * ceeg; run; And see what happens. 
Ive already done that. No missing values though. 
Thanks! so how would the titles be blue? cause SASdocprinter style is black as default 
Hi, just saw this response. I never figured out the issue, but apparently every other person in class was having the same issue with SAS on their personal computers, so the professor started just giving us the data in a readable format (.csv). Thanks for looking into it. 
Can you please help me out? I'm new to ODS and don't completely understand it. 
There is a way to alter specific colours, fonts, etc, but I usually just tell ODS that I want SASDocPrinter and leave it at that - accepting whatever it give me :) Sorry but you're on your own with your Google-Fu
What do you mean by "hang"? Does it run for hours? Nothing jumps out at me. You could also try another PROC that does the same thing. Try the same code, but use PROC MIXED. It might work better. 
I figured it out. I just forgot to add "quit;" i forgot you can interact with it after it is ran.
okay i already changed my proc sql query. can you please just tell me how to change the format of a specific column? i want to make it to dollar23. for example proc sql; create table tmp as select moolah from tblmoney ; quit; the column moolah is not yet in money format. how do i change the data to money? eg. 11234.55 wherein it should be $11,234.55 something like that. thanks for your time man!
merci. i will try this tomorrow. 
Google time series analysis.
You might need to use if statement instead of where. Check out the third example here: http://support.sas.com/kb/24/286.html
It would be more accurate to say that `proc sql` does the sorting for you. Also, it will needlessly re-sort already sorted datasets unless you tell it that they're already sorted. You can get a better idea of what proc sql is doing in the background using the (undocumented) _method and _tree options. 
So you want a grouped bar chart going in different directions. Would the scales be the same for both variables?
Yes, same scale for both!
Sorry it took me so long to get back. It looks like /u/jswilson64 had the same idea. Here is a working example. I don't use formats and gchart often so I had to reuse old code. There may be some stuff in there that isn't applicable. [Here] (http://imgur.com/hFwceXe) is the output. Below is the code used to produce it: data example; input day category $ value; datalines; 1 A 300 2 A 500 3 A 300 4 A 800 5 A 300 6 A 500 7 A 300 8 A 800 1 B -200 2 B -400 3 B -800 4 B -100 5 B -200 6 B -400 7 B -800 8 B -100 ; run; proc format; picture chart_axis (round) . = '-' .01&lt; - high = '000,000,000,000' (prefix='') low - &lt;-.01 = '000,000,000,000' (prefix=''); run; quit; title 'Chart Example'; proc gchart data=example; vbar day / discrete type=sum sumvar=value subgroup=category ; format value chart_axis.; run; quit; Edited to change link to photo. 
A few debugging hints for when you're dealing with macros: Step 1: Write normal code that does the task you need done on some simple (possibly test) datasets. Test that code. Step 2: Replace all the fixed references in that code with the appropriate macro variables, and up the top of the code define them to be equal to what you replaced. So for example, change a line that says "DATA work.inputdsn" to "DATA &amp;inp" and add "%LET inp = work.inputdsn". Test the code again. Step 3: Top-and-tail the code with %macro and %mend statements, and add any of the conditional or looping code you need. Then add a simple call to the macro at the end. Test the code once more. Step 4: Replace the %let statements with arguments to the macro. Change the macro call to pass the right arguments. Test the code again. Step 5: At this stage your macro is ready, so you can add things like option statements that stop writing stuff to the log if you really want. Test the code one last time.
Also also, I think there's an issue in the bit where you say you're calculating the mean of contin and rank of contin var, because the by statement means that it's calculating said mean within each value of &amp;binary, but the way you transpose the data in the next step suggests that you really want to calculate the means overall?
Thank you! 
So I'm understanding correctly, you still want the data on the x-axis to be plotted by day but you want the interval of the labels to show only weeks? Or in groups of 7 if that makes sense?
I'm not sure about sgplot but with gplot at least you can use an axis statement to define the exact set of tickmarks you want. You would probably need to write some macro code to generate the appropriate list.
 Try one of these for your xaxis: xaxis values=( list of date values ); or xaxis values = (*value-1* TO *value-n* BY *interval*) ; --------------- so something like xaxis values=('01JAN2014'd TO '31DEC2014'd by 7); might do it
There are some data manipulation that can be done in a few lines of SAS code that might be near impossible with SQL. Being familiar with both is exceptionally handy.
I think that everyone should learn SAS Macro. I knew 0 SQL when I began with SAS and learned SQL several years after working in SAS. FYI I primarily work in data manipulation/management of large and wide data but also in integrating SAS with application GUIs which is a whole different story. SAS Macro has two immediately powerful features in proc SQL: * It allows you to iterate through consecutively named things like columns (see caveat). This gets very interesting when you abstract it to the next level and you are instead iterating through consecutively named Macro variables * It allows you to dynamically assign data set values to Macro variables that can then be used to fire off conditional processing of other data or even used to build data set names for smart processing Caveat is: you can reference column ranges in base SAS already like (keep= myCol1-myCol99) You can use these techniques with the automatic "datasets" accessed through proc SQL as dictionary.columns, dictionary.tables, etc. (views are in sashelp as Vcolumn etc.) to do very interesting things to create very dynamic and reusable code
It depends what sort of work you're going to be doing. For anything beyond fairly basic statistical work, the SAS procs will be a better option. If your data are already in databases that you can connect to via proc sql, that can be a very good option, but if you need to import/export to or from other formats, procs and data steps may be the only way to go. Another general point - if you only need to process each row independently of all the rest in a dataset, sql is usually fine, but if you need to set up sequential logic (i.e. such that each row depends on what happened in one or more previous rows), data steps are often a much better fit.
thanks! the parameter line was confusing me, I really appreciate the response!
Concerned that you have quotes around the parameter in your comparison. IF grade &lt; &amp;cutoff THEN status = 1; Add the following in your DATA step. LABEL status = "Status";
Sorry for the late response. It is reasonable that series is more suitable for this type of data. I will return if I fail again :)
Tried it before I posted but it didn't work...
SAS uses the capitalization used when the variable is first introduced in the program. So capitalize it the way you want in the second data step you show in your program. SAS will then continue to use it that way no matter how you refer to it later on. then Status = 1; else status = 2;
In the data step, write ... then Status=1. Should show up in proc freq the same way you write it in the data step. 
It sounds like you want to first delete the duplicates based on date, which you can do with a PROC SORT using the NODUPKEY option. PROC SORT DATA = &lt;data&gt; NODUPKEY; BY date; RUN; Then a simple DATASTEP using the MERGE command instead of a SET command. Note both datasets need sorted by the ID before merging. DATA NEWDATA1; MERGE DATA1 DATA2; BY date RUN; 
That gets you part of the way, but to get var2 in the form wanted, you need something like: DATA NEWDATA1; MERGE DATA1 DATA2(IN = in_d2); BY date; occurence = in_d2; RUN;
You've understood it correctly, sorry if it was unclear. I will try this out. Thanks a lot for your kind help! 
Excellent question! I can see running R within SAS/IML since it can pass data and objects back and forth directly. In fact, it is kinda cool. But I'm not sure exactly what the point here is except you get to do it in Java rather than a CMD box.
You might try modifying to this: xaxis fitpolicy=thin ; or xaxis fitpolicy=rotatethin ; or xaxis fitpolicy=staggerthin ; As pointed out, vbar, hbar, vbarparm, and hbarparm are implicitly type=discrete axes and cannot be typed to time. But the above tweaks will operate and may get you what you want.
No I'm only studying off a book and online practice questions. I found this question in a PDF and searched it online but couldn't find an explanation just an answer. It's Question 2 on this website http://www.sas-exam.com/sample-questions/sample-questions-sas-certified-base-programmer-a00-211
Code and log output: http://imgur.com/a/Z6TNb In the absence of any clear explanation or additional assumptions that are required as part of the question, the answer given on that page is clearly wrong.
Ok thank you for clarifying this, I'll take your output as the answer and find some other place to find questions. 
In base SAS I like to use the ODS Graphics Designer utility (It's under Tools), create the panel effect I'm after then grab the code and modify it afterwards. 
If this is a one off, you could open a command prompt, cd into the folder then dir /b &gt; filelist.sas Edit filelist.sas, search and replace .sas7bdat with nothing. Replace underscore with comma. Replace start of line comma with a macro name. Replace end of line with ); So you end up with a bunch of lines like: %MyJoin(001,20050426); %MyJoin(002,20050429); ... etc Then build the macro to wrangle up a date valule and assign it to your date field, and join the result to your OneBigTable. This is left as an exercise for the reader :)
Sorry, on my phone, but you could just replace the offending space with a hyphen (or better, underscore... I hate hyphens). Also, depending on the version of SAS, you could refer to it as 'two-year college'n

ah ok and for the race since its UP to 11 characters if I write it as race : $11. Its saying to use 11 characters or up until the default delimiter which in this case is the space. now if I write it as race $11. Its going to always go 11 characters and basically throw off the remainder of the data... Really appreciate you taking the time to help me!
I haven't tested this code, but it should get the general idea down. First, run a proc contents for your directory containing all of your data, outputting that to a dataset. Then, get all of the dataset names by running a PROC SQL query on that resulting dataset, and then append them together. This assumes that each of the 633 datasets have the exact same metadata (column names, lengths, etc.) and that these sets are the only ones in the directory. libname myFolder "directory containing your data"; %global count firstSet; proc contents data=myFolder._all_ out=work.contents; run; proc sql noprint; create table work.datasets as select distinct memname from work.contents; quit; /*Get the first dataset name so we can create the set containing all of your data sets*/ data _null_; set work.contents (firstobs=1 obs=1); call symput('firstSet',memname); run; /*This counts the number of datasets you have*/ proc sql noprint; select count(*) into: count from work.contents; quit; /*This creates a dataset with 0 observations but the same columns as your data sets, and a date column*/ data work.result; set myFolder.&amp;firstSet; length date 8.; format date date9.; stop; run; %macro doIt; /*for each data set, do this*/ %do i = 1 %to &amp;count; /*get the next set name*/ data _null_; set work.contents (firstobs=&amp;i obs=&amp;i); call symput('setName',memname); run; /*create a temp set with the current data set plus a date column*/ data work.tempSet; set myFolder.&amp;setName; dateText = substr(strip(scan("&amp;setName",-1,"_")),1,8); date = input(dateText,yymmdd8.); format date date9.; drop dateText; run; /*Append the temp set to the result set*/ proc append data=work.tempSet base=work.result; run; %end; %mend; %doIt;
You would have had even bigger problems if Race had contained spaces as well as being variable length, with space being the only delimiter - it's very hard to cope with more than one variable like this per line, at the end of the line, as in this example. In most real-world examples I've encountered, files that need to be imported tend to be either delimited (e.g. CSV) or fixed width, not this weird mish-mash of the two that you've been tasked with importing here.
Wow, I'm a novice with SAS, and you make it look so easy. This worked great. The only thing I had to change was to set work.datasets instead of work.contents in a few places. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this. 
8 gigs seems plenty. It runs on my netbook with a Celeron processor and 4 gigs. But it depends on what you call *intense*. Is that regression with umpteen variables, manipulating 10 gig data files, or you haven't a clue? 
I work there, so I use it almost every day. I like coding.
For data with embedded blanks, I think you want to use the "&amp;" modifier. So your your INPUT statement should look like: INPUT ID ... Education &amp; $17. ; [From SAS](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/basess/58133/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a001360509.htm) - &gt;with the colon format modifier (:) you can read: character data that contains more than eight characters numeric data that contains special characters. &gt;Because list input uses a blank space to determine where one value ends and the next one begins, values normally cannot contain blanks. However, with the ampersand format modifier (&amp;) you can use list input to read data that contains single embedded blanks. The issue with ampersand is that the variable being read has to be delimited from the next variable by two spaces, but since this is at the end of your data that's not really a concern. 
Sounds like you're right. It's possible your practice test had a wrong answer. What practice test are you taking? I will add that even the SAS Prep Guide has been know to have some wrong answers... 
I'm taking the practice exam off the SAS official website. It's the only practice test. Here's their "explanation" The LENGTH statement only gives the variable Name a predefined maximum length
Ah, alright thanks. 
Hey maybe you can help. I search for a way to edit the Message in a popup Window produced by: dm 'post "Attention!!! The Macro ERROR-Detections found a problem Process was stoped Please check your log for details"'; First i just want to do a line break but it would be cool to make some notes bold and bigger. The Message should look like : **Attention!!!** The Macro ERROR-Detections found a problem Process was stoped Please check your log for details 
Funny, I was trying to do the same thing today. Inserting any non-printing characters as hex literals causes all the subsequent text to be ignored, as are line breaks in the code itself, so there isn't any way to do this via `dm` as far as I can tell. You might however have better luck displaying a popup via use of the `modulen` function - i.e. having SAS ask your OS to display a popup rather than using the DM windows. This is a bit fiddly and the amount of space available for text is very limited, but on Windows this allows the use of title / body text and a choice of icons with very little code. Alternatively, you could design your own window via the use of the `%window` and `%display` statements.
Nice THX i will try it tomorrow. You got an easy code example for me?
Which aspects of SAS are you looking to hold within the cloud environment. SAS offers a lot of products, with a lot of features. I doubt you could effectively showcase all of these in a single environment, as a lot of these offerings require multiple servers etc. Assuming you are talking about a basic SAS Studio (code) cloud environment, then I would probably showcase a little bit of taking a CSV, importing it through code, merging with other data sets, building a report, and exporting this report into a Word Document/Excel File/PDF via ODS. If you have a metadata server, and appropriate products, developing this into a Stored Process which could be called from a Web App, or from SAS Add in for Microsoft Office connecting in to the cloud environment could be interesting as well. Depending on your licencing arrangement with SAS, I know SAS AMO has a standalone install, so if you are demoing this onsite, and have appropriate access, you could even install AMO at the Customer Site (Takes about 5 minutes), and call the pregenerated stored process report down. A lot of this will depend on how big a cloud you have, and what you intend to showcase.
Great input. We are starting with VA and Analytics Pro but your points about customer info make sense. The cloud server is 32-core with 128gb and SSDs with about 8TB of storage. 
Thanks - yes, we are working to enable consultants selling SAS to their clients and want to demonstrate customized solutions. You read it right. Great advice thanks. 
Thank you so much for the advice!! I will watch them right now! :) 
It looks like a bit of a nasty crash. I think you have to talk to SAS.
Thanks, I'll try that
Hi, I'm making a new data asset in DI. I'm importing a CSV into SQL with a little transformation in between. The data suppliers rather helpfully deliver the data with no column headers. We have a user written transformation which pulls in parameters from a csv. So in my parameter CSV I have I have something along the lines of SourceDate,03_2015. Got that working for the general parts of my DI job. As the data has no header, I'm loading the headers to the data from an external file, again this is working fine. I have something like Month_1_Cost, Month_1_Volume, Month_2_Cost. Month_2_Volume and so on and so forth. So what I want is for the Month_1 header to read my parameter file, and name the column to say 03_2015 which I think I can do, however Month_2 needs to be 03_2015 - 1, so it becomes 02_2015 and so on and so forth counting backwards. The changing name has to be my parameter -1, as obviously the date changes each time, the parameter is seen as text so I'd right &amp;SourceData (or sometimes "&amp;SourceData."). and SAS would change it to/see it as 03_2015 I then want to transpose the whole thing (which I also can't get working). I've attached a before/after picture of what I'm trying to do. Thanks.
You're already doing this in the most elegant available manner. How often do you need more than 32 leading digits anyway?
The only thing close to that would be letting SAS choose the formatting for you via the default [bestw.](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a000184495.htm) format.
Unfortunately, I think that also doesn't guaratnee that you'll get 2 decimal places.
I would send feedback if you feel that an answer on the practice exam is incorrect OR you feel that a practice question in the Prep Guide is incorrect to training@sas.com so they can check the version of the Practice Exam that being used. Make sure you send them the name of the Practice Exam and the question number in doubt and the Prep Guide title, Edition number and page number. If you feel that there is a problem with the actual exam, as administered by Pearson VUE, then I would send an email to certify@sas.com with the date of the exam and your Exam Candidate ID number so they can investigate further with Pearson VUE. Hope that's helpful! 
&gt; %let path=/Users/myname/Downloads; libname SAS "&amp;SAS"; Oh, thanks, that was silly of me. Replaced it but it still comes up with the same message?
Is that path in your computer? If that's the case, are you sure SAS Studio is running on a local server and not a remote one? 
Anyone?

You could try leveraging the INTNX function to get your other calculated field names. That would allow you to subtract one month from the value your parameter is passed in. General syntax would be like this: INTNX('month', '06JUN2015'd, -1, 'same') Which would return '06MAY2015'd. You'd have to do modifications to get that into the format you want. Assuming it's in Date9 format, you could just rewrite with; Newdate=put(month(datefield),z2.)||"_"||put(year(datefield),z4.); Which would convert the date field you've got to MM_YYYY format like you want in your example. The tricky part is going to be dynamically applying this to each month, assuming you don't have a set amount of months that you receive each time. If you knew there was a set amount of months each time you receive this file, you could just create a bunch of records like Newdate1=, Newdate2=, etc using that generic formula above, and then write each one out as a macro using CALL SYMPUT. I hate being generic, but reddit is blocked at my work and this is already a pain to type. 
Not sure what you mean by the column header box or the expression box. I was thinking you could use a CALL SYMPUT statement downstream from the calculations and do something like. DATA _NULL_; SET yourdata; CALL SYMPUT ('Date1',NewDate1); . . . CALL SYMPUT ('Date24',NewDate24); RUN; That way you've got all of the MM_YYYY values you wanted in your transposed Date column. This would only handle that column. As far as the transpose, you'd have to do some extra legwork.
The best way to do this is in a loop, and the simplest way to do that is indeed through a macro. First, here's the most straightforward way to convert your old code into a efficient, macro version: data want; set have; %macro changes(prefix); &amp;prefix._annual_change = (&amp;prefix.2000-&amp;prefix.1990)/10; &amp;prefix.1991 = &amp;prefix.1990 + &amp;prefix._annual_change; &amp;prefix.1992 = &amp;prefix.1990 + 2*&amp;prefix._annual_change; [ ... ] &amp;prefix.1999 = &amp;prefix.1990 + 9*&amp;prefix._annual_change; %mend changes; %changes(abc); %changes(def); [keep using %changes(); for all prefixes] run; Now here's a sexier approach: data want; set have; %macro changes(prefix); &amp;prefix._annual_change = (&amp;prefix.2000-&amp;prefix.1990)/10; %do i=1 %to 9; &amp;prefix.199&amp;i. = &amp;prefix.1990 + &amp;i.*&amp;prefix._annual_change; %end; %mend changes; %changes(abc); %changes(def); [keep using %changes(); for all prefixes] run; Good luck!
If this is a one-off task, then fine, hard-code your 100 macro calls, but if there's even a moderate chance of the code being reused (i.e. with variables added or removed), then I'd definitely automate it and perhaps even consider moving the macro to a separate file in an autocall area.
Proc report is your best friend
I'd suggest learning how to: * Run SAS programs as batch jobs, for ease of automation * Generate html / pdf output via the Output Delivery System (ODS) * Send emails (either by interfacing with sendmail, or by having SAS talk directly to your SMTP server) * Set up an autoexec folder for storing macro definitions so you can reuse code, and assign it automatically when you launch SAS * Use `lag`, `retain` and `by-group processing` which are key concepts for SAS data steps and procs, but alien to SQL, as they depend on row order of your dataset.
Also tabulate
Learn how to interface PROC SQL with your database system and find out about any issues. This will likely be either the direct SAS/ACCESS for your DBMS or SAS/ACCESS for ODBC or SAS/ACCESS for OLEDB. Interface issues include whether to use LIBNAME or PROC SQL to get the data. If LIBNAME, learn the data step. If PROC SQL, find out whether you expect to want SAS or the DBMS to handle the functions and find out whether you need to send hints. In other words, focus on getting the data in and out accurately before worrying about the statistics.
REPS=250; the data set will have a variable named REPLICATE for each replication PROC SURVEYSELECT DATA=myData METHOD=URS REPS=250 OUTHITS SEED=3588941 OUT=myReplData SAMPSIZE=100; RUN;
With `method=urs` you may find that the same observations appear in more than one sample. If this is for bootstrapping, that's fine, but if not you may need to pick another sampling method.
EG has a lot of features and "hand holding". Whether or not you use those is kind of up to you. Sometimes the hand holding gets in the way. I can't say I use much of the extras. Sometimes I'll use the wizards to help me picture a code, but I end up having to modify it quite a bit. You can make use of things like prompts to give projects to people who aren't programmers sometimes, but many of them end up intimidated by even that. I do like process flows though! Saves me from long, winding codes or having to organize %includes.
Glad to see somebody likes process flows. We are actually looking for a way to get rid of those. Our old scripts work much more efficient.
I definitely prefer the streamlined approach of plain jane Base over EG. I don't use any of the fancy stuff and it seems to complicate things if all you're going to do is base programming anyway. 
Look up SAS Essentials I &amp; SAS Essentials II on the internet, both good resources for learning SAS. Also, check out 'The Little SAS Book: A Primer' 4th or 5th edition. That book really helped me when I started in my programming position using SAS. [Book on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-SAS-Book-Edition/dp/1612903436) [support.sas.com/training](https://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/) If you have a little experience or none at all using SAS, this is a great place to start. [SAS e-learning](https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html?ctry=us&amp;productType=library) Great place for e-learning modules using SAS. In terms of how long it should take really depends on you and how fast you can pick up the concepts in SAS. I've been working in my SAS programming role (Biotech/Oncology) and I still learn something new everyday. It's a fun language to use once you get the hang of it and can do some cool things with it too. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me and I will try to get to them as soon as I can. Hope this helps!! :)
I never did take a SAS qualification, but am biostatistician in a CRO nevertheless. I'd suggest you talk with your biostats department, and see if you could replicate some analysis and data preparation. That would be more fun than just going for the exam and never hurts. In addition, I have heard a qualified tell that the qualification included quite some reading/importing of data tricks, which SAS has many tricks for and which I never use. You did install and play with SAS studio I assume?
I wasn't too crazy about it at first, mainly because I couldn't use code for importing/exporting files from my local server - you have to create a special "step" for that but if you modify the name you have to modify the step through the wizard instead of just changing the code. Also, for some reason we didn't have the option of exporting to .xlsx files, so anything over the 65K limit (frequent) had to be broken up and reassembled in Excel. I used to have problems with my scrollbars freezing or my log not showing up but haven't seen too many lately. In Base SAS, you can open and view more than one dataset at a time and compare them, which is great for debugging. In SAS EG the best you can do is to run programs in two different nodes and toggle back and forth between them so it's more difficult to do a quick comparison. I don't know if there's a way to "undock" the dataset views in EG so they can be put side by side; I haven't been able to find a way on the Internet. Having said all that, I like the idea of being able to organize my programs into smaller blocks.
&gt; view more than one dataset (...) run programs in two different nodes and toggle back and forth between them so it's more difficult to do a quick comparison Probably I am misunderstanding, but you can put two datasets next to each other. You can split the screen in two panes and put something in each. 
Domestically, I use the USGS, but what you may try is googling something like "shapefiles of Germany zipcodes" (or the equivalent in German). I saw some some results on the first link: http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/25060/postal-areas-for-germany-shape But I don't speak the language. 
SAS University Edition: http://www.sas.com/en_be/software/university-edition.html contains all of the information you need to learn SAS. The software can’t be used for commercial purposes—only for learning and research. Take a look at the software options for individual learners . I also know SAS has free tutorials View SAS training "how to" videos, tutorials, and demos to learn tips and tricks for working with SAS software: http://support.sas.com/training/tutorial/
It's usually bundled with full SAS installations, you might have some trouble getting it installed with the university edition. However, the coding in either environment is the same and [you can start here](https://www.youtube.com/user/mbate001?feature=hovercard) to get moving pretty quickly through the basics.
Do you know how to construct simple queries in SqL? If yes then it's gonna be easy for you to learn the basic of sas. Select * from tbluser in sas Proc sql; Create table tbluser as Select * from library.tbluser Quit;
While this is true, relying on proc sql is dangerous as you miss out on the optimizations available in SAS data steps.
 proc sql; create table tbluser as select * from library.tbluser; quit;
I slightly disagree with what you said. Using proc SQL in addition to SAS data steps go hand in hand if you know how to use it correctly. In fact, you can trim down a lot from a program by using Proc SQL only. Throw in a few macro's and you have a quick, short program.
Depends on the program. SQL does not handle things like rolling counters, for example, well at all.
My point was only using proc sql misses out. Off course there are situations where it is the right choice.
Thanks for this, I might give it a go. Are you using the University Edition?
When you start the course, they ask which SAS you are using. The options available are: SAS Studio (University Ed), Enterprise Guide, or base SAS. I'm using base SAS. At first glance, it seems that the purpose of this is to help you find menus or shortcuts, but the code itself doesn't change.
That's a great explanation, but I would add that there are some things that only proc sql will do. Specifically, if you need a Cartesian product from two data sets, it's pretty much the only way.
CTRL+I FTW!!! I am a formatting freak with my code and one of the few options of EG that I was excited about.
Do you have SAS installed on a PC or server that can connect to the sql server database? If so, the most direct option is to write a SAS program that connects to it and runs some sql code.
It's been a while since I've done a stepwise regression, is that in PROC LOGISTIC? What are the results when you add OUTPUT= in the procedure? If there is somewhere that lists the variables - or if you have the ability to run PROC CONTENTS and get *that* to list out the variables selected - I have an idea for getting the variables selected into a list format that is either separated by commas or by spaces, but it kind of depends on how that first output table is constructed and how you intend to use the variables moving forward. I have a list of valid values that I use for this one project that is constantly being updated, and the list differs depending on which field I'm doing analysis on. PROC IMPORT DATAFILE="\\MyData\VALID_VALUES.xlsx" DBMS=XLSX OUT=output.VALIDVALUES REPLACE; RUN; Then I generate a macro variable (separated by commas) of all of the values that show up: %macro FULL_VALIDVALS(field=,); /*Create a macro called VVLIST: wraps the field VALIDVALS in single-quotes and separates each value by commas. Create for each individual field*/ /*PUT THIS INTO A LIST FORMAT THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE INSIDE OF IN STATEMENT*/ PROC SQL; SELECT "'"||strip(VALIDVALS)||"'" /*REMOVE ALL LEADING AND TRAILING BLANKS*/ INTO : VVLIST SEPARATED BY ',' FROM output.VALIDVALUES WHERE FIELD="&amp;field."; QUIT; %PUT &amp;VVLIST; RUN; %mend FULL_VALIDVALS; %FULL_VALIDVALS(field=STATUS_CD); Then downstream I can use this macro as a list inside of an IN statement when I'm trying to find non-valid values. I feel like you could potentially use something along these lines, depending on what it is you want to use those for. 
Can you use the (free) [SAS University Edition](http://www.sas.com/en_ae/software/university-edition.html)?
or you could use WPS: http://www.teamwpc.co.uk
I'd try reaching out to SAS directly. They might be willing to cut you a hefty discount if you make your clients continue their dependence on SAS. 
Why don't you just call them and ask about your options? SAS Analytics Pro is $9,000 and includes Base, STAT and GRAPH. Regardless, the SAS business model really isn't designed around 'at home' use - it's excellent software (and support), but in your situation you might want to put some time into learning R.
You need to put the recode statements (if/then) in a data step. Right now they aren't part of any proc or data step, so SAS doesn't know what to do with them. Try this. data examplesset_recode; set examplesset; newvar=.; If oldvar=1 then newvar=1; run;
Yes.
I don't know if you already tried this, but that is what helped me when I did it: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/connref/67174/PDF/default/connref.pdf
That's just part of the problem. Apparently if the transport files weren't generated by XPORT (regardless of the kind of step) and instead by CPORT then they have to be CIMPORT'd back in. No COPY if no XPORT at the source. The additional issue is that it's encoded wlatin1 and we literally just 3 months ago switched to utf8...so I feel your pain.
There is a lot that it could be but im going to guess that your data is being paged to disk and that is killing your performance. An integer takes 4 bytes to store. If you have 800k observations and 17 variables its going to take somethink like 56GB of memory. You have 8 minus 1.5 for the operating system to run. If you divide it out you can fit about 95k observations in memory. Try that. If it works much quicker you know that is the case. You can also check the performance in performance monitor. If the disk queue length is way above one then SAS is waiting on the disk.
Thanks a lot for your reply! I'm hesitant to stop the program now in naive hope that it will be finished soon, so I'm putting off trying it with the subsample. But, I did look into the performance monitor stuff. In the performance monitor, SAS isn't even showing up as an "image" (whatever that means) using anything on the disk. The disk queue length is hovering around .01 with occasional spikes up to as much as .05. I don't know if it is useful information at all, but, while the program is running, in the task manager under Kernel Memory (mb), it says that 328 MBs are paged, and 103 are nonpaged. Also, ~52% of my CPU is in use (almost exclusively by SAS, which is also using 40 threads), and ~60% of my physical memory is in use (SAS appears to be the main contributor to that as well, and it has 0 hard faults/sec). So, it looks like the data aren't being paged to disk. At least, as far as I can tell. Do you have any idea what else the problem could be?
Well i tried! From what you say i was wrong, its not paging to disk. It looks like your cpu is pegged out. You will just have to wait it out. I know the cpu says 52% but thats from 8 cores. Hyperthreaded cores arent real so it messes up the count. You have 4 cores plus some opportunity to use cycles that would normally be wasted. I wish there was a way to estimate run time. I dont know of a way. 
What previous runs did you do and how long did they take? Next time I'd suggest you start with something small and ramp up gradually to more and larger samples with more complex models.
Your comment just made me realize the problem.... Running it without the model averaging, it took about a minute. But since I'm resampling the data and running the model 1000 times, assuming it scales linearly, it would take 1000 minutes. Which is like 17 hours... Oh my god, I'm an idiot. That seems so obvious to me now... If that is correct, then if I resample and model only 100 times, it should only take a bit over an hour and a half! Though I'll lose some stability, it may be worth it for the sake of efficiency... Does that make sense to you? Because now I want to go back to the office and rerun it with a few different numbers of resampled models to test the theory. If it makes sense outside of my own mind, I'm super excited to go back and fix it. Lol. **EDIT:** That didn't do it... Tried doing some smaller tests like running it with no resampled models, then with 1 resampled model, then 2, and by that point it was running too long to continue to wait for it. I think I can confidently say it does not scale linearly. So, I ran the program over the weekend using 100 samples, and it ended up taking about 9.5 hours. It's not great, but at least that means I only have to wait for it to run over night rather than over a weekend. Still didn't give me a parsimonious (nor particularly powerful) model, so I may just have to do something else (perhaps binning the response variable and using LDA or logistic regression to predict membership).
Okay I found something over at the SAS support (http://support.sas.com/kb/25/557.html) and I tried to recreate what has been done but all I get is warning saying: WARNING: Variable DATA_KENNZAHL not found in data set WORK.DATA_KENNZAHL. DATA_KENNZAHL is the DATA SET for GMAP and my FORMAT statement in GMAP looks like this: FORMAT DATA_KENNZAHL KENNZAHLFORMAT.; KENNZAHLFORMAT is the format which I defined in my programm like this: PROC FORMAT; VALUE KENNZAHLFORMAT LOW - 1000 = '&lt;=1.000' 1001 - 5000 = '1.001 - 5.000' 5001 - 20000 = '5.001 - 20.000' 20001 - 50000 = '20.001 - 50.000' 50001 - 100000 = '50.001 - 100.000' 100001 - 500000 = '100.001 - 500.000' 500001 - 1000000 = '500.001 - 1.000.000' 1000001 - HIGH = '&gt;1.000.000'; RUN; Did I misunderstand anything or am I just simply skipping over a mistake?
Hey, heads up first this is not a really elegant solution but i am new to SAS and have never done something quite in that direction, so this just an idea. Reference all the library via a short with LIBNAME and then just JOIN them together with ON a.id = b.id you can to two at a time or just all in one(I think that might hit your performance hard though). Also if you can see the data sets in the library folder on the SAS server you are connected to you should just be able to right click it go to settings and look for it that way(Doesn't take as long to load as opening). Hope this helps even though it is a fairly basic idea 
It is the value of an observation. So I have like a bunch of libraries with datasets that most have one variable, ID, in common. They all have different other variables though. I also have a list of IDs. All I need to do is scan all the datasets to see if they contain these IDs. I guess I would want to know which datasets have the IDs.
If you have a very short list: first write a bunch of data steps to narrow things down to just the IDs you want. E.g. data lib1_ds1_ids; set lib1.ds1(where = (id in (id1, id2, ...))); run; Do this for every library and dataset. If you have a list of the libraries and datasets, you could write a macro to generate the data steps. You can then think about how you want to join everything together without having to worry about such a big performance hit. Or if you have a somewhat longer list, load it into a dataset and do a merge or some other join with each of the datasets in your libraries. E.g. data lib1_ds1_ids; merge my_ids(in = a) lib1.ds1; by id; if a; run; This will only work all your datasets are sorted by id in ascending order, or indexed on id. Otherwise, you will need to either sort/index your large datasets (which takes ages) or do a hash / format merge. These are more complex but perform much better. See [here](http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings09/197-2009.pdf) for further details.
I would create a small dataset with the library and dataset using sashelp.vtable. In a macro loop, I would do a proc sql check for the particular value in each dataset listed in previously created dataset and create some kind of flag to indicate if I find the data in particular datasets. Let me know if you need more info, I can help later.
There are lots of ways you could do this. Here's one: %macro loop(DSLIST); %local CURRENT_DS i; %let CURRENT_DS = dummy; %let i = 0; %do %until(&amp;CURRENT_DS =); %let i = %eval(&amp;i + 1); %let CURRENT_DS = %scan(&amp;DSLIST, &amp;i, %str( )); %let DSN = %scan(&amp;CURRENT_DS,2,.); %if %sysfunc(exist(&amp;CURRENT_DS)) %then %do; data &amp;DSN; set &amp;CURRENT_DS(where = (ID in (ID1, ID2, /*Insert further IDs here as necessary*/))); run; %end; %end; %mend loop; %let DSLIST = lib1.ds1 lib1.ds2; /*Insert further dataset names here as necessary*/ %loop(&amp;DSLIST);
You can use the SQL dictionary table 'dictionary.columns' to derive your list of variables which are unique to each dataset. proc sql ; select name into :VARS separated by ', ' from dictionary.columns where libname = 'MYLIB' and memname in('DATASET1','DATASET2') group by name having count(name) = 1 ; quit ; This will load the list of unique variables into a macro variable called VARS, which you can then use elsewhere, e.g. in another PROC SQL proc sql ; create table merged1 as select coalesce(a.ID,b.ID) as ID, &amp;VARS from MYLIB.DATASET1 a full outer join MYLIB.DATASET2 b on a.ID = b.ID ; quit ; 
In the directory "/courses/dc4508e5ba27fe300/c_629/saslib", do you have a SAS file that is called "Missing"?
Good answer!
You're right that I shouldn't need an input statement if I use set, but it's saying that I do.
I'm not sure what the assignment is, but are you sure you're required to use the INPUT *statement* and not the INPUT *function*? Separately, I took a look at your log and your length statement should come immediately after the DATA statement. Otherwise it's not going to do anything. I still think you need to get rid of the INPUT statement. You might be running into an issue with the way the data set was encoded (for example, if the data set was created using SPSS or something similar) but it doesn't look like SAS minds based on the log. 
The reason you're getting the error message is because you're getting different input methods confused. SAS provides many ways to input data, but they boil down to three main methods: * Input an existing dataset. (set) * Input an external file that isn't a dataset (such as a text file). (infile) * Specify the individual lines of data that need to be input, as part of the datastep. (datalines) You're trying to do the first, but writing syntax as if you were doing the second or third, and SAS is complaining: "ERROR: No DATALINES or INFILE statement." Datalines is the third method, Infile is the second. I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to do with this step as it looks like you're not trying to change your data in any way. Assuming that's the case, you actually don't need to worry about the data step. If you're just trying to print your data, you can print based on the dataset in the initial library you assign. I.e. libname mydata "/courses/dc4508e5ba27fe300/c_629/saslib" access=readonly; proc print data=mydata.Missing; run; The libname statement creates a 'shortcut' to that directory, which allows you to therefore reference any datasets in that directory, in the form &lt;library&gt;.&lt;dataset&gt;. The reason you don't state a library sometimes is because there exists a library called WORK. This is unique for each SAS session, and the contents get wiped when you exit the session. If you don't specify a library, SAS assumes you meant work. The two statements below would both write to the same output dataset: data NameOfDataset; /* Implicitly writes to work */ set mydata.missing; run; data work.NameOfDataset; /* Explicitly writes to work */ set mydata.missing; run; If you're trying to read an existing dataset in, in order to add more data to it or similar, you only need the set statement. For example; data Missing; set mydata.missing; run;
You need to put quotes around the A, B, and C: if person = 'A' then x1=1;
also, you shouldn't be making dummy variables for your dependent variable. AND if person is a nominal variable outcome then you shouldn't be using proc reg either. ETA: I think you might mean to have: proc reg data=; model y = day x1 x2 x3; run;
yeah, I realized that a few minutes later haha thanks! Unfortunately, it still comes up telling me that there is significant bias in the model but I think that was intended within the question. Thanks for the help!! :) 
also be careful of your dummy variables. if you're trying to create a reference cell coding scheme then you only have two dummies for a 3-level variable. (my bad above, I should have written model y = day x1 x2;). there is more than one way to create dummy variables, but they are not interpreted the same.
Nvm, I used substr and did it.
Thank you very much for your answer, it was exactly the kind of function i was looking for. Can i ask you a little thing more? Can I use logic operator after memname to choose how take variables from different datasets? I mean, if i want only the common variables between both is there an "and" option? If i want only the variables of the first data-set NOT contained in the second data-set, does exist a way to write something like "if a and not b"? To do that i usually create two distinct data-sets with variables name and then do a merge with the correct option to selectt the desired intersection. Thank you again for your answer
Try using `group=` combined with `subgroup=` on the vbar statement.
There are a number of ways to do this which require you to connect to the database in a specific way that requires you to have the appropriate version of Office (32bit / 64bit) installed. The most simple way is using the LIBNAME to connect directly. You can also try an explicit ODBC connection. Note that this can lead to lots of problems where data types are not the same - lost in translation, so you have to be very careful; always backup your data and test everything. The following might work better with an SQL statement to do the update. LIBNAME mymdb ACCESS "C:\myPath\myData.mdb"; DATA mymdb.thisTable; SET mymdb.thisTable; firstname = SCAN(Name, 1); lastname = SCAN(Name, 2); RUN; LIBNAME mymdb CLEAR; 
The libname and memname conditions in the where clause refer to your two dataset library/names, not columns within those datasets, and hence they should be different. For efficiency, you should move the libname/memname criteria to the join-on condition, leaving just the missing(b.name) in the where clause.
Thank you all for answers /u/drlionelraymond /u/xmindallas /u/analytix_guru The job is in risk modeling for auto loans, Ive added the job description: ---------- MAIN DUTIES/TASKS: Credit risk analysis and modelling of auto loan and leasing portfolios Assist Risk Manager Auto throughout the budget process and produce forecast for the auto portfolio on a monthly basis Partner with the rest of the Auto risk team and run monthly controls and deliver monthly reporting Profitability calculations on larger credits Work with Commercial within Auto for development of new initiatives to ensure all Risk aspects are covered Participate in Risk projects locally and, where applicable, with Nordics to ensure timely delivery with high quality Develop, monitor, analyze and implement champion challengers on a continuous basis Identify improvement areas, and develop routines, solutions and systems related to risk and analysis -------- Are there anything youd like to add or simplify? Thank you all so much, again 
Some other packages that may be of use to you would be SAS/ETS (time series), SAS/IML (for working with matrices), and SAS/ODS (output delivery system, for exporting charts, graphs, figures etc.). Really depends on a particular companies environment. There are even packages specific to risk management/modeling for the insurance and banking industries, but I'm only mentioning those just to make you aware that they exist. Definitely wouldn't waste my time learning those until it was absolutely necessary.
They are looking for 1-2 years of experience and graduates, as Im a graduate I don't know how to complete these tasks, but Im sure I will with some training. The SAS part hasn't scared me off yet, as I have experience with other econometric software. The position is in the national branch of a top 50 in the "Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's largest companies". Thanks for the help
Sorry, I wasn't trying to discourage you. It seems that sometimes the tasks don't match up with what they're really expecting. It also sounds as if they are expecting this person to work with a lot of different areas, which is great in terms of learning the data and the business. Good luck!
It's especially useful for accessing networks, with just a Drop-down for Network Drives and you can Click a Button to Connect to Machines on your Network, there's a built in Command Prompt Button as-well. It also Loads really fast which is nice.
I make SAS tutorials on YouTube :) just Google "Mikes SAS tutorials" or search the same terms on YouTube.

Thank you for the quick response. [code]proc sql ; create table col1 as select memname from dictionary.columns where libname = 'ac' and name = 'WirelessNumber' ; quit ; [/code] It shows 0 results. It should have 4. Any suggestions?
Try: where upcase(libname) ="AC" and upcase(name) ="WIRELESSNUMBER"; 
Interesting question. I ran it just now, and the results are: test_date = 24JUL2015:00:00:00 test_dttm = 24JUL2015:15:51:40.950000048 test_count = 84 Which seems to lend credence to your 3rd part database hypothesis.
As the data for libname &amp; memname in dictionary.columns are already in upper case, the upcase(...) aren't necessary, but the below would be more appropriate. where libname = upcase("ac") and name = upcase("WirelessNumber") ;
df$y&lt;-df$x/sum(df$x) Ha. Clearly thought I was in rstats. Sorry. 
 proc sql; create table new_lib.new_table as select * ,x/sum(x) as y from old_lib.old_table; quit;
This is your simplest answer, although you should also get comfortable with using proc means for the sum and merging it on using a data step
Okay so... I am a noob and I tried to do it this way. proc means data=math noprint; var x; output out=sumx(keep=xsum) sum=xsum; run; data math2; set math; if _n_=1 then set sumx; y=x/xsum; drop xsum; run; I was just wondering if it was like this.
